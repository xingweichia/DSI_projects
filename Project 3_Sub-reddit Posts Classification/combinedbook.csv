audiobooks,I am a 24f and I only listen to audiobooks with a male narrator. I just can’t seem to get into the story if a lady is narrating it and I don’t know why? Does anyone else have this problem. I’m currently reading Phantom by Jo Nesbø and it’s narrated by Robin Sachs who I feel was a great narrator. My brother jokingly calls me sexist but I’m curious is anyone else like me.
audiobooks,I am using the app Libby to listen to audiobooks. How would I go about getting a digital library card for a different state? I am wanting more audiobooks than my area offers.
audiobooks,Is there a way to bookmark where i am in a audiobook on groove music? every time i exit it starts a 26 hour book from the beginning? help!!!
audiobooks,"Hi all,

""The Zombie Letters"" by Billie Dean Shoemate III, newly released on audio is an exciting thrill ride for those seeking their fix of our favorite undead villains.  This tale gives a fresh and unique perspective to the 'zombies are taking over the world' theme and keeps you in suspense right up to the unexpected ending.

If you would like a free Audible code, please message me or reply here and be sure to let me know IF YOU WANT A US or UK CODE.

Thanks!

audiobooks,"If anyone watches the movies 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' and 'A Series if Unfortunate Events' they'd realize how good of voice and rhythm Jude Law has for narration, and probably wonders like i did if he had recorded a narration of any book.

My search has only come up with [one where he voiced a character](https://www.audible.com.au/pd/The-Tales-of-Beedle-the-Bard-Audiobook/1781103798?qid=1596838184&amp;sr=1-1&amp;ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_1&amp;pf_rd_p=771c6463-05d7-4981-9b47-920dc34a70f1&amp;pf_rd_r=VQ3FBEZT4DXG0GR2YDK8), and several poetry publications, but I'm looking for something more narrative.

If anyone knows any more books please share, and if there aren't let's consider this a petition to get him to the booth."
audiobooks,"Okay, two “free” books a month is nice. That covers the cost of your paid membership, but all of the audiobooks I’ve found and wanted to buy are upwards of $20..... for an audiobook. That doesn’t seem like a very good “special membership” price. I listen to a ton of audiobooks monthly from my library. 

Am I crazy or is audible just NOT worth it?"
audiobooks,"I love reading/listening about history, especially war history. I don’t know as much about the war in Iraq and Afghanistan as I would like and I was wondering if there were any good books documenting these wars. I know that they’re still going on, so it could be hard to find an up to date book. I appreciate the help."
audiobooks,"I loved her Saga of the Pliocene Exile, Galactic Milieu, and Black Trillium series when I was a teenager, but I’m surprised to see she has one - just ONE - audiobook available. 

After some googling I can’t seem to find any explanation. This seems like an odd oversight, since I thought she was one of the major female voices in SciFi/Fantasy. At least her books were everywhere in the 90’s. 

Anyone know what the story is? Thanks in advance."
audiobooks,"So I am sucker for The Great Courses Plus (tgcp). A year and half back I got bored of watching of tv shows and reading books (nothing seemed to interest me) and I found tgcp. On and off when i get time, I subscribe and watch courses. So I watched some of them and wanted to rate them and write a sentence or two about why you should get them on audible (or subscribe to tgcp, upto you). 

1. A History of Hitler’s Empire by Thomas Childers- The first ever course I completed on tgcp. Man, it was amazing. Some might find the way he talks a little odd but i found it very alluring. He has a way of talking that makes the whole course seem ominous, dark, and seems like he really really knows hitler. He tries to explain how hitler thought and how germany was back then. Definitely recommend 6/5

2. How Great Science Fiction Works by Gary Wolfe- He explains all the themes of science fiction and delves into its history. Okay, this one is real good provided you don’t mind mild spoilers or have read a lot of science fiction books. Personally I haven’t read many scifi books, so I felt like many of them got spoilt (not exactly spoilers, he tells what the main theme of the book but doesn’t spoil the story, my fault for getting annoyed, but I still finished the entire series because it was good). So 4/5. But if you are a person who doesn’t care about the premise of the book and is more into the writing and buildup, then you wouldn’t mind this course and the little ‘spoilers’ it has. 

3. Modern Political Tradition by Lawrence Cahoone- This course is must take to understand politics. It will provide a solid base for you to dwell further into political philosophy/theory or hold your ground in a political debate with your friends/online (because now you would have understood and heard the terms they  are using) or at the very least, do clever shitposting on political subreddits. 5/5

4. The Great Tours African Safari by James Currie- Handsome South African guy takes a very good and passionate course on African  safari in a South African accent. Absolutely amazing. However I think you need to watch this course on video format (because you know, he shows pictures and videos of animals).  5/5
(disclaimer- i still have 4 episodes remaining to finish it) 

5. World War II by Thomas Childers (again)- This one is a very fleshed out course on WW2 and he includes all the fronts and the reason I love his courses are - he includes a lot of context. He tells you the way leaders thought back then. Why they took the steps they did. Frankly it’s amazing 6/5 
(disclaimer- i still have 14 episodes remaining to finish it and yet i still recommend it because that’s how good it is!)

6. - The US and The Middle East: 1914 to 9/11 by Salim Yakub- Man I have been binging this for the past two days. Extraordinary. Absolutely unbiased &gt;!despite the guy being affected by the crisis in lebanon during 1970s!&lt; 7/5 
(disclaimer- i still have 5 episodes remaining to finish it) 

7. A History of the United states by multiple authors - This one just like thomas childers and salim yakub’s courses is frickin amazing! Similar to both of them, these authors go in depth and explain the world at that time instead of stating facts and leaving it there. Definitely recommend and is 84 episodes long. Definitely worth the audible credit ! 
(disclaimer- i still have 67 episodes (lol) remaining to finish it, but absolutely worth the marathon) 7/5

8. Algebra II by James Sellers and Precalculus by Bruce Edwards- This needs to be watched on video (because they do math problems). I didn’t expect math courses to be good, but damn they really are, I am currently halfway through both of them and definitely recommend them to anyone who had a bad history with math in school and wants to do them again or just wants to learn them for fun. I recommend other math courses by the same professors, because they teach really really well (I wish I had them in school). They have calculus and higher courses by Bruce Edwards. 5/5

8. Meteorology by Robert Fovell- Oh man, he explains it so well and makes science sounds so easy and intuitive ! 5/5
(disclaimer- i still have 14 episodes remaining to finish it)

Other courses that I have started and reached like till episodes 5-10 and would rate them 5/5 are, (i will write about them some other day when I finish more courses)

1. Everyday Engineering by Stephen Ressler
2. Nature of Earth: Intro to Geology by John Renton 
3. Law School for Everyone by multiple authors

One course I didn’t like was Mysteries of Modern Physics: Time by Sean Carroll and gave up on episode three and would give it a 2.5/5

Edit- thanks u/thereyes for giving me an award :)"
audiobooks,"Hi everyone! I'm looking for suggestions for things to do while listening to audio books please.

I started listening to audiobook recently to avoid watching too much mindless TV or YouTube videos.

However I quickly run into the problem of staring blankly into space and quickly getting distracted with things like reddit.

I don't have so much laundry to fold that keeps me busy for 2-3 hours.. And can only do stretches for so many minutes!

Sometimes I lie in bed and listen, but fall asleep and completely miss the content too.."
audiobooks,"Hi, everyone. My book A Bard’s Lament is coming out on August 31st 2020 and I’m getting an audiobook created for it too. It’s mostly for my dad since his eyesight is poor so he can’t read ebooks.

The book features three original (short) songs that the MC sings. What do you think of music in audiobooks? Would you want to hear them or have them skipped over? I prefer paperbacks so I don’t have that much experience with audiobooks or what people would think of music suddenly playing in the story. Thank you in advance."
audiobooks,"I have a new favorite narrator.  **Merritt Wever!!**  I've been re-falling in love with her, and someone told me about this audiobook and I looked at it, and this is totally not a book I'd never choose to read.  Ever.  But it sounds like Zoey from Nurse Jackie is reading it, and I'm happy with whatever happens.  :)

The book is **Last Night at Chateau Marmont** and I am over the moon! :)  I hope she does more.  

Has anyone else read it?  The author is **Lauren Weisberger**."
audiobooks,"Ok so if you don't know Christopher Lee is. He played Count Dooku, and sauroman. What the young people of this sub might not know unless you're a cinephile too is that he also played in a sort of series of Dracula films. The first ever Dracula film was in 1933, Christopher Lee played his first in 1953. It's very soothing for bedtime"
audiobooks,"I love both, just curious what you guys think :)

On the road I prefer adventure books, but at home, I prefer to cozy in with a horror audiobook."

audiobooks," 

I am an addict for romance stories, the crazier the better. I especially enjoy listening to audiobooks since I can “read” whenever! Today I want to share with you guys a few of my top romance audiobook picks! **If you have any recommendations for audiobooks you think I might like in this genre, please share them in the comments!**

&amp;#x200B;

* A Cry in the Dark by Denise Grover Swank

This book had my hooked from the start. The story is filled with many edge of your seat moments. So many twists throughout the story that I kept second guessing what was going to happen. Needless to say what I had expected to happen didn't and I loved that I couldn't predict the ending.

&amp;#x200B;

*  Cold &amp; Deadly(Cold Justice: Crossfire #1) by Toni Anderson

Ava Kanas and many other FBI agents are attending retired FBI agent Van Santos funeral when a sniper takes out one of their own. Ava is sure that Van Santos' death was murder not suicide but no one seems to want to listen…

I loved the way the relationship between Dominic and Ava played out. While they may have had an instant attraction, the actual relationship took time to build. I couldn’t get enough of the tension it created. The mystery, the action, the intrigue, the romance, I was riveted!

&amp;#x200B;

*  Sweet Temptation by Cora Reilly

""I’d never been a man for the sweet things in life, I suddenly craved it.""

Oh my gosh! I'm completely blown away by this book. This was the perfect single dad, age/gap, arranged marriage, MAFIA story. So Freaking Good!

&amp;#x200B;

* The Truth About Lies by Aly Martinez

Cora is basically a den mother and a slave to her Guerrero family ties, and Penn is the new maintenance man with a wicked back story that will break even the coldest heart.

What can I say, It’s intense, fun, heartbreaking, raw, gritty, emotional and romantic… Another fan-freaking-tastic romantic suspense by Aly Martinez!!

&amp;#x200B;

PS: I think romance audiobooks are generally inexpensive and easily available, recently I got all of mine for free from an App called Papaya FM (with the 14-day free trial!)"
audiobooks,Audible was launched in India not too long ago. I have been using it for past 5 months. I regularly don't find the books I am looking for and when I check the same books in other markets they are always available. Don't get me wrong there still are a lot of great books but collection is still quite sparse compared to other markets. I only enjoy non fiction titles though so can't comment on others.
audiobooks,"Loved these two books so much but I'm now at a loss of what to listen to next. Fry's writing and narration was such a comfort to me during quarantine and I'd like to listen to something that's just as good but I'm not sure how to specify my request. Yes, I'm that lost :/

Edit: Guys, thank you so much! I honestly didn't expect any replies since my post was so vague. I'm going to check out all your suggestions :D"
audiobooks,"Book II “The House of Vodouisant“ is now available on Audible/Amazon.  As the narrator, I have a few free codes for those interested in reviewing.  The first book was more of a Novella or short story of three main teenage characters who stumble in to a haunted manor house... This book catches up with them a few years later as some of them drifted apart, but their old nemesis has caught up to them... in a way.   Interested?  Here is a link to a promo on my YouTube channel.  Let me know if you’d like to review and I’ll message you a code.   [https://youtu.be/jsjcxuMb4Bw](https://youtu.be/jsjcxuMb4Bw)

Thanks!  Steven Miller (Narrator)"

I am pretty unhappy about this."
audiobooks,"Hi ya'll

Does anyone in here know if the Levar Burton reads podcast still is active? I've found it on stitcher but it doesn't seem to be updated regularly.

Does he like have one reading a day/week or month? or has he quitted the Levar Burton Reads? 

Does anyone have the complete list of readings that he have done? and no I'm not asking for piracy or copies I only want the complete list of readings that he have done, like headlines in text  so I can check if I've listened to them all

Thanks in advance.

Edit: thank you guys! All of you! I'm so glad he keeps on reading these short stories, because if him in hooked to reading."

audiobooks,"I'm in a bit of a conundrum, and would like to pick your collective brains for a moment.

I have a friend who is 75 years old and she loves to listen to audio books. With Covid19 and all the associated stuff happening, her usual go-to resource, her local library - is now closed and she can't access any CD books to take with her to her bi-weekly dialysis treatments.

As such, it turns out her library can let her download books to listen to, but here's the issue. Being 75 years old, she's not that tech savvy, and I need to find an MP3 player that she could operate simply. I can get her son to download the books to an MP3 player, so getting the books on it wouldn't be an issue, I just need to know if anyone knows of a sturdy, large screen (so she can read the titles etc) MP3 player that has a good battery life? 

Alternately, I've pondered just getting her an old used android phone and removing all unnecessary apps and seeing if I can't turn that into a mp3 player like setup for her to listen to her books

Any advice, tips, experience etc is greatly appreciated. Just trying to make her life a little easier in this crazy world we live in right now."

audiobooks,"I've never done this but I have some specific books I need to purchase to read and listen to SIMULTANEOUSLY.

Do I need an actual kindle for this? If so, what model is best?

Actually, I tend to use my PC at home and laptop when I'm out. Is there any way I can do it through my PC and laptop?

Occasionally, I might even want to listen (not read) while I'm out and about with my Iphone.

For the most part, I want to read and listen at the same time.

Where do I buy audiobooks?

I have no idea what I'm doing and would just like a simple breakdown."
audiobooks,"Does anyone else get kind of annoyed when a book concerns a decent amount of people in a dangerous situation and none of them die?? The last few sci-fi/post apocalyptic books I read were very good, aside from the plot armor surrounding every single character. 

This annoyance probably stems from all of the Stephen King books I’ve read where you can be in a someone’s head one paragraph and read about them dying in the next. The surprise is nice, even if I really liked the character. Please any recommendations are welcome."
audiobooks,"I just got some credit and I'm looking for something else to get. I already pre-ordered ready player 2  


Recent Series I've enjoyed

* Awaken Online
*  Bobiverse
* expeditionary force (prob my favorite)
* Magic 2.0
* Threshold series"
audiobooks,"I like listening to fiction audiobooks while I run - plots that keep me interested and curious enough to pull my focus from the task at hand. 
In my experience, best sellers lists on all the apps typically fall into a few cats, none of which do it for me: mysteries about murdered/missing/otherwise dead girls, one-note male govt agents caught in a conspiracy situation, Janet Evanovich (insert name with a number), stuff by James Patterson, stuff by John Grisham, or Harry Potter.

I’ve read the Harry Potters, and the rest seem tired.

Into fantasy, sci-fi, mysteries, spies thrillers (Alias!), romance, etc... 
You name it, I’d just love to read something from the perspective of a woman."
audiobooks,I am new to this realm and I am trying out audible trail. It seems a bit pricey but I guess the 1 credit a month averages out to 1 book a month. Are there any better ones out there?
audiobooks,"I have never listened to an audiobook and im currently without a job. So i would like to use my free time to listen to a good book, a classic maybe. But i can't buy one right now.
Do you know a source of good, free audiobooks. In spanish would be a plus."
audiobooks,"
The Gardener of Baghdad is a historical fiction I wrote more than six years ago. It is currently discounted at chirpbooks for $3.99. 
If you have any inquiries about the novel or about Baghdad, I will be more than willing to address them. A quick glimpse about the novel:

""Two people, one city, different times; connected by a memoir. Can love exist in a city destined for decades of misery?""

Adnan leads a weary existence as a bookshop owner in modern-day, war-torn Baghdad, where bombings, corruption, and assault are everyday occurrences and the struggle to survive has suffocated the joy out of life for most. But when he begins to clean out his bookshop of 40 years to leave his city in search of somewhere safer, he comes across the story of Ali, the Gardener of Baghdad. Adnan rediscovers through a memoir handwritten by the gardener decades ago that beauty, love, and hope can still exist, even in the darkest corners of the world."
audiobooks,"Has anyone listened to a great thriller lately? Could be scary, murder, investigation anything! They are my refresh when I need a palette cleanse after some heavy reads. 

Things I’ve enjoyed - You, Hidden Bodies, various Agatha Christie, The Silent Patient, Verity, The Witch Elm"
audiobooks,"I finally broke down last week and bought Shogun from Audible. It's the longest book I have in my library by far, at over fifty hours. I've always wanted to get through it, and I'm very familiar with the first 200 pages of my paperback version since I've read them four times.

I struggle to finish anything longer than five hours in a reasonable timeframe, but I've been getting better. Last week I finished A Ballad Of Songs and Snakes and the first Hunger Games book, 15 and 11 hours respectively. I didn't start Ballad last week but still got in about twelve hours in a week.

I've put myself on a weekly schedule to get through four chapters a week until it's done (and more is okay if I find myself in a groove). But some days I just... Don't wanna. Even though I desperately need something to occupy my mind at work, I find myself thinking about the books in my library but endlessly scrolling YouTube instead. I think I'm just intimidated enough by long books that become a self-fulfilling project prophecy by just not playing them when I can.

How do you get through long books if you're not someone who gravitates to them naturally but you really want to hear a particular story?

If I can get through this, next should be The Way Of Kings."
audiobooks,"I've found with books with a lot of people/characters I lose track more of who is who with audio books. This happens when I'm not completely focused on the audiobook like when I'm driving or housework. Anyone else? 

I just listened to a book about a military unit with a lot of casualties and new people joining the unit as things went along and lost track. Wonder if audiobooks might benefit from being a little different  treatment than written books when there are a lot of characters. I think with written you can thumb forward and back to get yourself on track. I had the same problem with Middlemarch (which I didn't finish). Maybe narrator can read out the different characters in the end in order of how many mentions they have later in the book or have the info later -something like ""at 7:25 on this audiobook is a list of characters/people."""
audiobooks,"I am starting an audiobook project and I was wondering if it would behoove me to find some background scoring and SFX. I personally prefer not to have the extras but it’s never made me not listen to something and I know a number of audiobooks and book series that use them. I figured the best way to get a solid answer is to ask other fans of the medium, so let me know which you prefer, please and thank you!"
audiobooks,"I've been trying to read this book for ages but am having a hard time getting part the halfway point. I found there is an audiobook version read by Dick Hill (one of my favorite audiobook narrators) so I'm super excited to listen to it, but I can't find it anywhere. Does anyone know a place to buy it, or have a copy they'd be willing to sell or loan?

Thanks!!!!"
audiobooks,Hi I was wanting to start a channel reading stories to help people sleep and relax. I don't want to infringe on anyones work but I don't know where to go to find books that ok to read and record without getting in trouble. Thanks for the suggestions and help.
audiobooks,"Hey guys,

I like to read a lot of audiobooks directly off my PC (usually in mp3 format). Windows Media Player gets the job done but not well.

Are there any PC audiobook players that have a hotkey/shortcut for jumping forward/back ~15 seconds? This is one of my favorite features in the mobile app I use, and is useful for when I don't hear something correctly."
audiobooks,"Greetings everybody!

A newbie to the community here. Nice to get acquainted with you all. I’m a young entrepreneurially minded and independently working writer/poet from Iceland. I need some audiobook suggestions from you professionals to listen to during my upcoming road trip through mainland Europe.

Really don’t want to waste precious driving time only listening to music while I could be educating myself. Some books I already like are books about entrepreneurship like Think and Grow Rich and Rich Dad Poor Dad as well as biographies of successful people in all professions.

I also like good fiction. Being a writer myself, working on a novel, it wouldn’t hurt listening to a good novel that might hone my own story writing skills or provide inspiration. Novels with positive messages like The Life of Pi and the Alchemist are among my favorites. Really don’t like any downers or disturbing thrillers. 

All suggestions based on the books I mentioned would be greatly appreciated! 

Thanks so much in advance 😊
—A brother from Iceland"
audiobooks,"I have a number of audiobooks in my dropbox. When I go onto my iphone to listen to them, I have been first exporting them to an app called mp3audiobookplayer. I downloaded this because I cannot change the speed on the books inside dropbox and dropbox isnt really a decent player. The problem is that dropbox doesnt seem to be letting me export multiple files at once. This is an issue for many multi file audiobooks. Anybody have a solution? Change the mp3 player app? Not using dropbox correctly? Something else?"
audiobooks,Any recommendations for a long road trip? Last year we were driving all around Banff and listening to Kitchen Confidential by Anthony Bourdain was so enjoyable. Open to anything!
audiobooks,"I  started a free trial of Audible and got this book based off of having a credit for it. I didn't listen to the preview because that was a book I have wanted for a long time. Welp, backfired. It doesn't say this anywhere in the book's description and I did not read reviews because I did not want to be spoiled but apparently it goes back and forth between two  different stories with one happening in the present and another in the  past. In the actual book the only way to tell the difference is the past  is italicized. The audiobook is only narrated by one voice so there is  no dual voices that could have helped in the distinction.

Also, the narrator has a strong Australian accent which I have to really  concentrate to and often have to rewind to process the material. It  wouldn't be an issue normally but I got audible because I have a long  commute to work so wanted to pass the time and driving, processing the  material, and decoding an accent is nearly impossible.

So I guess my deal breakers would be accents and if it has a past/present aspect to use two narrators instead of one."
audiobooks,"I’m looking for something similar to Ian Mortimer’s “Time Traveller’s Guide to...” series, which is one of my favorite non fiction audiobooks I’ve ever listened to. I also really, really enjoyed The Physician series by Noah Gordon, if anyone has fiction recommendations along similar lines.

Thanks!"
audiobooks, What would you recommend for a beginner please. Thanks.

audiobooks,Hello! I recently narrated this audiobook with New Meg Publishing. It is a teen fantasy series with some light LGBTQ themes. It's a really good time and Audible gave me a bunch of Promo codes to give out so if anyone is interested please let me know in the comments and I will shoot you a code! If you get a code the book is FREE!
audiobooks,"All of the following books are mine (as in I wrote them). 

I'm especially eager to use up some of the UK codes, so if y'all have friends in the UK, please let them know what's available. Please comment and PM or open a private chat with me with a list of which titles you'd like and whether you need US or UK codes. Reviews are always appreciated but not required. I still get paid for these, so it's win-win for both of us. Feel free to ask if you have ques about any story.

audiobooks,"I'm pretty tired and I was thinking about what I would love to hear to make me sleepy. Then I came up with it. A dude with a really low, gravely voice, reading stories. When I say low, I mean like 2 octaves lower than Morgan Freeman. The type of voice you listen too and you think that their voice is low enough to crush cans from pressure.
What I'm asking is if anyone knows an audiobook or voice actor who reads stories with this type of voice. I haven't been able to find a podcast or anything with that type of voice, so I'm hoping audiobooks have one somewhere.

Edit: Right now, the best solution I have is The Bible  read by James Earl Jones. If you want a reference for the type of voice I want, imagine James Earl Jones, who voiced Darth Vader and Mufasa"

I narrated this book and would love to give you the FREE summer nostalgia escape we all deserve right now in exchange for a fair and honest review on audible.

When 19 year old Nate Burton is appointed the new manager of a local movie house it's not exactly the promotion of his dreams.  He's got a diva projectionist, rowdy customers, a thieving concessions counter girl, and that new automated projector keeps trying to eat the movies.   If that weren't enough he only got the job because the last manager was murdered in the theater parking lot and the suspects are everywhere possibly even in his own staff.  Meanwhile, another monster is on it's way.  It's 1975 and JAWS is about to change summer movies forever.

I’ve really gotten into audiobooks within the last few months and have so far listened to Neil Gaiman’s book about Norse mythology, and I am currently on Stephen Fry’s second book about Greek mythology. I love the way that Fry and Gaiman tell the stories of these myths! Their focus on characters and narrative make listening along so pleasant, and they both do an excellent job reading their work.

I have been intrigued by Arthurian legend lately, but I know next to nothing about it. Are there any audiobooks that detail the adventures of Arthurian legend in a similar style to how Gaiman’s and Fry’s books are constructed? Audiobook format is preferred, but I’d be interested in printed books as well.

This is coming from a physics graduate, no one actually speaks like that. Does anyone actually mention what their degree subject is as much as these characters do and base their whole personality around it?  Think this might be a return from me 

I feel like all the characters are basically the same people with slight tweaks too. Everything they do and say could be switched around and nothing would change.

audiobooks,"More and more over my adult life, my instinct to go to reddit, YouTube, ... as soon as I’m bored has grown. The instant reward of seeing a message from a friend on messenger. The instant reward of watching comforting videos on YouTube. All these I’m looking to lessen.


One interesting thing I’ve noticed is the correlation between that lack of attention and audiobooks. I’ve been reading more and more audiobooks and have kind of lost the ability to read books while being focused. I’m not sure if this is a good thing or a bad thing. 

Audiobooks allow me to listen to a story in a less focused manner, which is great for reading fantasy and other light genres, but which is not so great for reading science or heavier reading. 

I’m also starting to think audiobooks is a part of those bad instant gratification habits that I’m trying to lose, but I’m not sure. Its so much easier to start listening to something than to grab a book, as listening can be done with only half of my concentration. 

Has anyone else experienced this?"

I must say tho, i find particolarly annoying the overinterpretation given to some female characters by the actor involved.... they tend to sound extremely cartoonish at times... never mind the narrator... be it Jeff Cummings, Dan John Miller, or Nick Podehl.. every female character comes out as an hysteric housewife with too many years of marriage on her shoulders... the narration is otherwise competent and engaging (Cummings' take on Tagomi, Baines and Childan struck me as particularly inspired).

Somebody else read these books? what do you think?"

Fair warning: this isn't thinking man's speculative fiction, so don't expect some kind of allegorical treatise on modern society. My book--as you can't plainly see on the cover--is filled with toilet humor, terrible dad jokes, and thinly veiled pop culture references that probably only appeal to listeners who were alive when film-making peaked in 1998. That being said, I did get a couple of jabs in here and there.

This book does have outtakes at the end. You can get a taste of those [here](https://bit.ly/SlabSteeleFlareUps) if you want.

Please only request a code if you intend on listening. These codes are intended to generate reviews.

Not so much as a way to look down or judge people, just curious if i was outside the average ya know?

Well at the time of writing I have 264 Audible titles starting in 2011 (Isaac Asimov's I, Robot was probably my first book)

audiobooks,"I generally find 3 female protagonist tropes appealing and none of them are particularly sexual.

The Disney Princess- Adorable girl full of energy who wants to make friends with everyone no matter how ridiculous it may seem and go on adventures together. Usually wins over enemies rather than just destroying them and believes in the goodness of all. (Example: Erin Solstice from The Wandering Inn)

The Awkward Bookworm- She loves books and understands them more than people, feels not pretty and typically thinks of romance through the lens of bad fanfiction and cheesy romance novels. She loves learning and comparing real life situations to one of her stories. (Example: Hermonie Granger from Harry Potter and The Methods of Rationality)

The Mad Scientist- While not necessarily female this character is as Amoral as they are Asexual. Progressing science is their drive and that usually means they are attempting to take over the world to achieve their goal. Usually they have a noble cause but don't have a problem experimenting on their victims if it furthers their cause. (Example: Emma from The Laboratory Series)

I tend to like Fantasy and Sci-Fi but usually stick to smaller more raw genres like r/gamelit , r/Litrpg , and r/rational . I don't mind regular Fantasy or Sci-Fi it is just difficult to sort through for me. I also love  discovering new genres if you know a good one I might have never heard of let me know. Timeloops/second chance wish fulfillment and reborn in another world/ form are my usual cup of tea but I open to anything really."

audiobooks,"I've been listening to the audiobook for the new Hunger Games book, ""Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes"". I'm not big on audiobooks, I'd much rather read a paper book, but I figured I'd give it a try as a replacement to music while I walk my dog, do the dishes, etc... As such, it's taken me quite awhile to get through it. I'm about halfway through the book, and all of a sudden, Hoopla refuses to play this title, but won't say why... It just says ""There was an error"". I don't know how to fix this.

I tried downloading a visual novel, and it loaded up just fine. I tried downloading another audiobook (""You Should See Me in a Crown"") and it started playing immediately. I tried to start Ballad up again, and it just keeps giving an error message.

Anyone have any idea why this is happening, or how to fix it? I assume it's either because it's a fairly new, popular book, but it could also just be something else. It just sucks that my first attempt at an audiobook has been shut down for like a week now. I kept hoping it would fix itself but it hasn't yet. I can just get the book at the store and finish it that way, but I'm just wondering if anyone else has had this problem, or knows what causes it, or how to fix it?

Sorry if this is the wrong place to post this - I couldn't find a Hoopla help thing, and saw several older posts about Hoopla on this subreddit."

audiobooks,"I was searching for new free decent audiobook sources and ran across something I'd never seen before. It is restricted to Military and Veterans and requires official verification process or use of CAC Card (Military ID with Chip) for those who have access to a CAC Card Reader.

The main one I found after registering was through MWR. They have access to RB Digital which is related to services available through some local libraries like Hoopla, Overdrive or Libby.

There were two more other sources I believe but were kind of difficult to navigate. There is also a movie streaming service called Kanopy but Im not familiar and didn't take the time to check it out yet.

Just wanted to share as Im always appreciative when others share new sources they have found. Lord knows I could go broke if I had to rely strictly on paid subscription limitations or paying retail cost.

You register and verify at militaryonesourceconnect.org and then once logged in it will list the individual services available. Check it out and hope this benefits someone. Sorry its limited to military and veterans. If I run across something for General Public Ill be sure and share."
audiobooks,"So I was looking for something to listen to the other day and I did not care to much if it was a good story. So on seeing a book narrated by R.C. Bray and Jeffrey Kafer I thought ""Fuck it at least one of them is competent.""

On listening to it however I can't help but feel Bray was hired purly for his name's selling power. As in the book in question both narrators voice a male lead alternating respectively. Brays however happens to be a African American. 

This begs the question. If you can hire arguably two of the biggest names in audiobook narration, why could you not hire a African American to play Brays role?"

The cost of buying a book and reading can oftentimes be much greater than $5. Just curious if anyone would be willing to pay for something like this.

I am a big fan of audiobooks and this weekend I motivated one of my friends to give a shot to listening instead of reading. Since English is our second language, it is a great way to remember your vocabulary and liste to a native speaker at the same time with benefit of enjoying a great story!

So, my friend is 40 y.o. woman who aked me for a historical romance. Time span from medieval to WW2. Male or female narration doesn't matter, but since it would be her first try with audiobooks, I would like to hook her up with some great delivery!

Before he can ever become a champion, Jackson must tame his first monster - a wild, feral Djinn left to him by his dead mother. And then there’s the small problem of fighting in illegal underground tournaments. 

Join Jackson and his team of Djinn as they level up, tame new monsters, and battle their way to the top of the league. Skills will be tested, powers unleashed. Victory won’t come without a cost.

audiobooks,"I'm up to date with that serie, and I'm kinda feeling tired of it.

I just finished Oathbringer and feel like even if the next one was already available, I wouldn't download it.

I *felt* that there was no ending in sight, and Wikipedia just told me that I was merely on 3 out of a 10 projected books before hoping to get closure.

I really like the creativity of Sanderson : the sprens, the ecology, the multiple dimension, the long lost civilizations, the magical world and the way the characters are finding out about it. 

I like the light touch of humour and the way characters are evolving, the unveiling of their past crimes and bad ideas and where they are now.

But, what I thought at first to be an epic journey to reach a comprehensible goal is already making me feel like when I was reaching  the 4th book of Craig Alanson in that Expeditionary Force serie : it's a freaking soap opera!

The rythme is good and I feel like things are going forward, there is action, people dying, people joining in, new adversary that turn ally, there is a couple of major twists about what we thought was going on but turn out to be the opposite, yeah, I like that...but *where is this going?*

Are they gonna kill the bad guy (of course they are), are they gonna find how they where able to make a whole civilization switch dimension (yeah, of course)....but I'll have to plow through the whole life of those characters before witnessing it.

And for a reason I'm not able to express clearly (because I like a lot of aspect of that serie), I really don't feel like it. The writing is good, has it's moment, but is not exceptional. I often feel there is no weight behind some scenes.

I think it's on me in great part, I like closure, I like a final point to a paragraph and I like to understand ""the message"" the author is trying to pass along...

But I don't feel like surfing on a story line taking thousand of hours to kill the bad guy though.

What are your thoughts on that couple of books? Are you strapping in for the long haul? Is your soul already too shattered by some Game of Throne-like eternally unfinished scenario?"

So now I rip them. I used to use Freac which I could rip one CD to one file but towards the end of the file it would skip and miss. I switched to EAC (Exact Audio Copy) and it converts one track to one file. As long as you number them and use MP3Tag they come out find. Ripping 10 CDs does take some time and you have to be there to swap out CD, by some time I mean maybe 10 minutes  a CD."
audiobooks,"I find audio books difficult to follow when there is a change in scene and the narrator continues without missing a beat, reading on without any change in tenor, tone, pitch, cadence, or any other discernible change.  This is especially jarring when the change in scene occurs within a chapter and is not accompanied by any text to indicate the change. Sometimes I will listen for minutes before I realize that the setting or the cast of characters in the scene has changed.

What I don't get is why don't ebook narrators put more effort into making a scene break more audibly distinct. I really appreciate when narrators pause for a beat, adopt a slightly different cadence, or even adopt a different tone, when shifting from one scene to a different one.

It seems to me that some narrators just breeze through the text without a break to take a breather.  It is almost as if they want to achieve perfect consistency.

As someone who has done voicework, I can attest to how easy it is to make a small change in the room in which the recording is being done or in the microphone configuration that will cause a noticeable change in how my recorded voice sounds. In fact, it is actually a challenge to make my voice sound exactly the same.  I now can tell when a snippet of voiceover audio has been re-recorded. 

As a reader, I prefer some variation in the sound of the narrator's voice from scene to scene."

I'd be glad to try anything you think is decent and easy enough to understand for me :)

I'd love something long or with multiple parts coz im listening quite a lot.

audiobooks,"Here's a shout out for an Audiobook I'm currently listening to which should be of interest to both history buffs and those who are interested in understanding what's going on in the world right now.

William L. Shirer: The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich  which is a classic biography of Adolf Hitler.  As a foreign correspondent in Germany 1934-40 Shirer was able to see much of the period of Hitler's rise first hand.  The book was first published 60 years ago and was a much acclaimed bestseller.  The audiobook version is well narrated and at 45+ hours provides plenty of ""bang for your buck"" .  The book is very much an in depth account so is likely to provide plenty of new information even for those who think they are already familiar with these events."

audiobooks,"I decided to pick up and listen to a bunch of titles from Tom Clancy's *Jack Ryan Series*.  I had one of these in my Audible Library already, ""Clear and Present Danger"" from *Brilliance Audio*.  It is listed as Unabridged, narrated by J. Charles, appears to be converted from a CD Audio version, clocks in at 25 hours 52 minutes, and is no longer available for sale via Audible (though I can still download and listen to it).

When looking at other books in the series I noticed that [the new version of ""Clear and Present Danger"" available via Aubile](https://www.audible.com/pd/Clear-and-Present-Danger-Audiobook/B004EBZ2GI?qid=1594927531&amp;sr=1-1&amp;ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_1&amp;pf_rd_p=e81b7c27-6880-467a-b5a7-13cef5d729fe&amp;pf_rd_r=EA79HWXGV6Z64XK6CGBH) is from Random House Audio, narrated by Michael Prichard, and clocks in a little over 30 hours.

Anyone have any idea why there is a 4+ hour difference between the two?  That seems like too big of a difference to chalk up simply to narration style.  I wasn't really planning on picking up the new one (especially after seeing some of the reviews regarding the narration), but I wonder if there is something *missing* from the version that I already own."
audiobooks,"I received an email yesterday asking me to pay the annual fee of around $50, with a 3 day free trial, after which I would be charged. The free trial info wasn't in the text of the email, but was instead in a popup button I had to press to activate the trial. 

I pressed the button and then went immediately into my iphone subscriptions to cancel as soon as the free trial ended. To my surprise, it showed that I would have access, after cancellation, until July 15, 2021. I looked at my bank account and sure enough, I was charged the annual subscription fee. I immediately contacted them, but their response was that I had already had the free trial last year. I don't remember ever using it, but even assuming I did, there was never any indication from them that I was ineligible for the free trial and would be charged immediately. They then said they would look into it. REALLY?! They were told it wasn't intentional immediately after it happened and they don't take the high road and apologize, cancel and refund me. They ""have to look into it.""  And no, I have not used it at all since then. No justification for charging me at all.

Whilst doing this I was pleased to note that almost all of them were available for instant checkout. But when I checked my wishlist, every single book is no longer showing as available and I just have the hold button.

Even weirder, if I find the book through the search function instead of my wishlist the same book still shows as available and can be borrowed instantly. So, I can just do this as a workaround, but I’m wondering if this is a widespread glitch.

audiobooks,"FYI... coming from android, and trying to find a good audiobook/lecture app.

Had a couple of questions about Bound:

What granularity can you control playback speed? That is, .05, .1, or just big jumps like 1 to 1.25 to 1.5?

Can you jump back from the lock screen or with headset controls?

This is a long shot... but does it have an ""audible"" buttonless playback mode, where you can just tap to pause and swipe left/right to skip back/ahead?

Thanks. I've been using bookmobile which I'm relatively happy with, but the headset and lock screen controls suddenly stopped working.

I also tried the audible app, but for some reason it has a hard time remembering where it is at in the files I tested, so, e.g., it might jump back 2 minutes instead of 15 seconds. I noticed BookMobile can sometimes suffer from this but not nearly as bad as Audible, particularly after I started adding books via google drive. Anyway... still looking for the perfect app. Smart Audiobook Player is da bomb for anyone on android."

audiobooks,"Hello, all! 

**Some backstory:** 

I've recently delved into audiobooks, which are rekindling my love of pleasure reading after a two-year stint without the free time to do so (who woulda thunk a Master's program in English would make you *read* so much?). I started with the first book in *The Wheel of Time* saga, and was pleasantly surprised at the consistency of quality of the recordings. Ready to dive into audiobooks headfirst, I started collecting everything I could get my hands on for cheap or free, including some older recordings of Isaac Asimov's *Foundation* saga. Having made audiobooks my main companion during a daily commute of about an hour per direction, I was surprised (and more than a little disappointed) at the quality of the transfer - the audio was a little thin, there was a constant hum, and the general volume was quiet enough to be barely audible even cranked to max volume on my car's stereo. 

Being a hobbyist musician and knowing my way around Audacity and other DAWs (namely Ardour), I just *knew* there had to be a way to save the recordings. After much tinkering, a little bit of research, and plenty of hair-pulling, I managed to work out a system I liked, and got it working as an effective macro in Audacity - so much so that I need only open one file to capture some data and then automate the entire rest of the task of improving the mp3s. 

Bear in mind, I'm a complete novice when it comes to audio engineering, and there's only so much that can be salvaged from a poor transfer, but here's the process I've found to be most effective when dealing with converted audiobooks. Hopefully, this will be useful for anyone looking to improve MP3s found on the web or trying to convert their own tapes to digital. 

**The part you actually clicked for (**[and an imgur gallery to illustrate](https://imgur.com/a/kaBy2ag)**):**

Whether or not I'm working by macro, my first step is *always* noise reduction. Conversions from tape, unless properly edited after the fact, retain that tape hiss that can be overbearing at times. Audacity's plugin in for this is perfectly passable, and only requires me to grab a moment of the hiss to use as a noise profile. Given these files tend to be fairly low-quality, I've found no issue with letting Audacity be aggressive with this step. 

My next step is a Filter Curve (if so desired, the same effect can be accomplished via a Graphic EQ, but this worked best for me). The curve you use is entirely dependent upon the needs of the audio file, but generally, you want to cut out the low bass, moderately boost the mids, and more heavily boost the highs. Some rules of thumb are to cut anything under 60Hz, put one peak (\~2/3 of your max volume) around 200-300Hz, and max out anything above 6000Hz. 

After this point, I usually get some peaks that are dangerously close to clipping, so I use Audacity's Normalize to keep everything as loud as possible without distortion (or at least any more distortion than the recording already had). To allow any room for additional processing, I normalize to -2.0db. 

Next, I run a compressor. This part isn't strictly necessary, but just in case the filter curve's pushed the audio farther than can be handled in a low-bitrate file (the files start at 64k, and are exported at 64k), this reins everything in. Like the normalization, this allows for the most amplification without distortion. 

By this point, I usually notice a bit of that hiss returning (the quieter the source file, the more amplification, and the more anything left behind by the first noise removal resurfaces). Running noise reduction again, with the same settings, tends to do the trick and leave the silences crystal clear. 

My macro uses another round of Normalization for safety's sake (this round normalizes everything to -1.0db, to give the maximum volume without clipping), then everything is exported back out as MP3 in the same bitrate as before. The file sizes tend to be just a little bit larger than the source files, but only by a hair. 

As an added step, I like to use MP3Tag to get all the files properly numbered - it's much quicker than doing everything in Audacity's menus, as MP3Tag can automatically number and bulk-edit tags, and is absolutely necessary when using the macro en masse, as the macro doesn't retain any tag data. 

The process isn't terribly time-consuming, and running it as a macro on multiple files only requires grabbing that noise profile before starting the entire process (as the hissing or other noise is pretty consistent across files). Lately, I've been dumping entire audiobooks into the macro at once and coming back half an hour later to check the results.

**TLDR for the impatient:**

To improve quiet and hissy audiobooks converted from tape in Audacity:

* Run Noise Reduction
* Apply a filter curve that cuts out frequencies under 60Hz, boosts 200-300Hz, and maximizes 6000Hz+
* Normalize to prevent clipping
* Compressor to limit dynamic range and prevent clipping
* Run Noise Reduction a second time to clear out any remaining hissing
* Normalize for safety
* Export as MP3
* Tag/Number with MP3Tag

&amp;#x200B;

If you read through that jumble of sub-amateur audio engineering, I thank you! I'm not sure how frequently the community comes across the issue of subpar tape conversions, but I'm happy to share my process regardless. If you've got any suggestions on how to get even better quality out of these recordings, please let me know!"
audiobooks,"I love listening to audiobooks while I work, and I'm constantly searching for new titles. I have the subscription for Audible, but also for Audible Escape, and since Escape has no maximum amount of books per month, I've listened to quite a bit of fluff and happy endings.

Unfortunately, the entire non-heteronormative stuff is bundled under the umbrella, and usually trying to search for lesbian literature brings a dozen books with a barechested man on the cover, and based on my experience, those aren't the books I'm looking for.

He mentions one night he was at home and noticed he was being watched and he then went to confront the men watching from their car and had a wise chat with them, which I wish I could remember. He also mentions its not great to get caught up in the information war.

AUDIOBOOK OUT NOW! **'Destinies Dark Game'**  Book 2 in the Evolution Series. Maybe read as a stand-alone. There are  still some UK codes left for the ‘Simulation Game’. US and UK for  ‘**Zach's Cross**’ from the popular 'Witchfinder' series, maybe read as a stand-alone.  
Do we live in a simulation? The Apocalypse begins. Are you prepared?

audiobooks,"I'm currently using the Scribd trial month and pretty satisfied with their service so far. Reading other reviews and threads on this sub has however made me aware of the throttling and overall lack of transparency and logic behind it. 
Similar services like Playster, Hibooks seem to be worse. 

I now found Papaya FM, which specifically ""no throttling"" in their advertising. Does anyone use this service? How is the selection and is it really unlimited?

(For context: I'm already using Audible with a German subscription where special deals and sales are very rare. The digital offer of the public library networks (such as Libby in the US) is not accessible to me due to residence constraints. I listen to audiobooks only once and do not need to ""own"" them. Basically I need an equivalent of Netflix for audiobooks ;))

TIA"

audiobooks,"Hello Reddit Audiobooks!

My name is Michael R. Miller, author of *The Dragon's Blade Trilogy*. I'm a huge fan of audio books. In fact I listen to more books than I read these days. As a child I was hooked on Stephen Fry's narration of Harry Potter, the Alex Rider books on tape, and later got back into reading by listening to Mistborn by Brandon Sanderson on audio. So when I published my own series I had to have audio editions made.

Some months ago I bundled my entire series into one long audio book bundle at 46 hours long. It's been doing well and I think people are really valuing the length for the credit in these crazy times. So I'm here to let you know it's a thing and if you're a fan of epic fantasy / sword &amp; sorcery you may wish to check it out!

It's a story of redemption, for an arrogant dragon prince who is reborn, secretly raised by humans, and must learn to become the king his past self never was.

In terms of tone I'd compare it to Brandon Sanderson - grit in the story and characters but little swearing (one F word in book 3), not much gore, and just one sex scene which tastefully fades to black. It's an adult book but anyone from 14+ should be able to read and enjoy it.

audiobooks,"[**The Living Dead**](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Living-Dead-Audiobook/1250755247), a present-day zombie novel by George A. Romero and Daniel Kraus is coming in August, with narration by Ken Foree and Bruce Davison. (18 hrs)

The early reader reviews from [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52379448-the-living-dead) are solid, and it's got some terrific author blurbs:

&gt;“*The Living Dead* is a sprawling, timely, scary epic that honors the zombie tradition but also goes in new directions and takes risks that pay off.”―Paul Tremblay, author of *A Head Full of Ghosts* and *Survivor Song*  
&gt;  
&gt;“If *Night of the Living Dead* was the first word in the dead rising field, *The Living Dead* is the last word. A monumental achievement.”―Adam Nevill, author of *The Ritual*  
&gt;  
&gt;“Like a lost Romero classic, which will play out on the inside of your skull long after you've finished it.”―Clive Barker  
&gt;  
&gt;“A work of gory genius marked by all of Romero's trademark wit, humanity, and merciless social observations. How lucky are we to have this final act of Grand Guignol from the man who made the dead walk?”―Joe Hill, *New York Times* bestselling author of *The Fireman*  
&gt;  
&gt;“Every zombie movie lives in the shadow of Romero, but he never got the budget to work at the scale he deserved. Fortunately, Daniel Kraus delivers the epic book of the dead that Romero began. That shadow just got a whole lot bigger.”―Grady Hendrix, author of *My Best Friend’s Exorcism*  
&gt;  
&gt;""\[A\] phenomenally enrapturing and reverberating work of art. Vividly illuminates the minds of the characters.”―*Booklist* on *The Shape of Water* by Guillermo del Toro and Daniel Kraus

Here's the publisher's summary:

&gt;***New York Times*** **best-selling author Daniel Kraus completes George A. Romero's brand-new masterpiece of zombie horror, the massive novel left unfinished at Romero's death!**  
&gt;  
&gt;George A. Romero invented the modern zombie with *Night of the Living Dead*, creating a monster that has become a key part of pop culture. Romero often felt hemmed in by the constraints of film-making. To tell the story of the rise of the zombies and the fall of humanity the way it should be told, Romero turned to fiction. Unfortunately, when he died, the story was incomplete.  
&gt;  
&gt;Enter Daniel Kraus, co-author, with Guillermo del Toro, of the *New York Times* best seller *The Shape of Water* (based on the Academy Award-winning movie) and *Trollhunters* (which became an Emmy Award-winning series), and author of *The Death and Life of Zebulon Finch* (an *Entertainment Weekly* Top 10 Book of the Year). A lifelong Romero fan, Kraus was honored to be asked, by Romero's widow, to complete *The Living Dead*.    
&gt;  
&gt;Set in the present day, *The Living Dead* is an entirely new tale, the story of the zombie plague as George A. Romero wanted to tell it.

Ken Foree was Peter in **Dawn of the Dead** (1978). It will be fun to hear him return to the zombie apocalypse. Added to my wish-list!  


UPDATE:  
Ken Foree is no longer listed as a narrator. :(  
Lori Cardille is now listed as a narrator :)

This book is much more than a story of someones past. This is a look into the drug epidemic that many (myself included) were not properly educated about. This book has the power to change the perspective of so many young teenagers about drug use, help parents find the strength to support and guide a child who is dealing with addiction while potentially helping those with high level jobs to give others a second chance and compassion when they come from a troubled past. This impacted me in such a positive way and was just a great reminder to treat others with compassion and to help those who struggle with abuse and depression."

Internal conflict.

Is it long enough to be worth a credit?
Is it a one-and-done book, or will it have replay value?
It looks good, but will it be good ENOUGH?

Argh!  I wish audible would offer shorter books and novellas for half credit.  Or allow 1 ""rental"" per month or something! 

I know they have a generous return policy, and I've used it a few times on books that bored me silly or if I didn't like the narration.  But I can't justify returning a book bc it's only 4 hours long.  And I can't rationalize spending a full credit on a book that short!

Looks pretty intriguing! Here's a [Teaser Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS4mGesO2m4).

&amp;#x200B;

Publisher's description:

&gt;***Please note:*** *This content is not for kids. It is for mature audiences only. Just like the original graphic novels, this audio adaptation contains explicit language and graphic violence, as well as strong sexual content and themes. Discretion is advised.*  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Hailed by the *Los Angeles Times Magazine* as ""the greatest epic in the history of comic books,"" *The Sandman* changed the game with its dark, literary world of fantasy and horror—creating a global, cultural phenomenon in the process. At long last, Audible and DC present the first-ever audio production of *The New York Times* best-selling series written by acclaimed storyteller Neil Gaiman (who also serves as co-executive producer). Adapted and directed by multi-award-winner (and frequent Gaiman collaborator) Dirk Maggs, and performed by an ensemble cast with James McAvoy (*It, Parts one and two*, *X-Men: First Class*, *Split*) in the title role, this first installment of a multi-part original audio series will transport you to a world that re-writes the rules of audio entertainment the way that *The Sandman* originally re-defined the graphic novel.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;When The Sandman, also known as Lord Morpheus—the immortal king of dreams, stories and the imagination—is pulled from his realm and imprisoned on Earth by a nefarious cult, he languishes for decades before finally escaping. Once free, he must retrieve the three ""tools"" that will restore his power and help him to rebuild his dominion, which has deteriorated in his absence. As the multi-threaded story unspools, The Sandman descends into Hell to confront Lucifer (Michael Sheen), chases rogue nightmares who have escaped his realm, and crosses paths with an array of characters from DC comic books, ancient myths, and real-world history, including: Inmates of Gotham City's Arkham Asylum, Doctor Destiny, the muse Calliope, the three Fates, William Shakespeare (Arthur Darvill), and many more.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;A powerhouse supporting cast helps translate this masterwork into a sonic experience worthy of its legacy, including Riz Ahmed, Kat Dennings, Taron Egerton, Samantha Morton, Bebe Neuwirth, Andy Serkis, and more. Setting the stage for their performance is an unprecedented cinematic soundscape featuring an original musical score by British Academy Award winner James Hannigan. Fans will especially revel in a new twist for the audio adaptation: Neil Gaiman himself serves as the narrator. Follow him as he leads listeners along a winding path of myths, imagination and, often, terror. Even in your wildest dreams, you’ve never heard anything like this.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;This first installment of the audio series *The Sandman* adapts volumes 1-3 of the graphic novel series (*Preludes &amp; Nocturnes*, *The Doll’s House*, and *Dream Country*).  
**Estimated run time:** 10hrs 50mins

Something that describes the mysteries of what hides in the minds of men who have become proficient at the art of military killing up close, without the false John Wayne bravado or the hammed-up Rambo-esque cartoonish bad-assery that would read like fiction.

Something like a dark character study. Michael Herr touched on it brilliantly, but all too briefly in ""Dispatches""."

audiobooks,"I wanted to let you know about an audiobook series I direct, featuring a trained voice actor reading Christian and Catholic classics. They are released in the form of a podcast. Some of them are public domain but about half of them are done with permission from Catholic University of America Press, who kindly lets us use their modern, scholarly translations of ancient works. [https://www.catholicculture.org/audiobooks](https://www.catholicculture.org/commentary/category/audiobooks)

A good amount of what we put out is writings from the first few centuries AD--the authors known as the Fathers of the Church, whose writings were hugely important in Christian history and thus in the development of Western civilization. For non-Christians or non-Catholics, the best known figure from this period would be St. Augustine. So far we have mostly done fairly short works, but we are about to start our more ambitious project yet--an unabridged recording of Augustine's massively influential book On Christian Doctrine.

In addition to these ancient writings we do some more recent things, especially by St. John Henry Newman, who was reputed as the greatest English prose writer of the 19th century.

We have also just started getting into some dramatized readings--such as St. Thomas More's Dialogue of Conscience, a riveting record of his last conversation with his daughter before he was beheaded by King Henry VIII.

Occasionally we venture further afield, as with our recording of Nobel Literature Prize winner Aleksandr Solzenitsyn's famous Harvard commencement speech. We have done some poetry readings too, and at some point may try our hand at fiction if we find something really good.

Enjoy Catholic Culture Audiobooks!"

I am not really interested in any that take place in outer space.  I'm also not totally thrilled with demon/vampire type books but am not totally against it.

Anyone have any lesser known gems that are hilarious with a great narrator?"

audiobooks,This is a great audiobook about the rise and fall of the Comanches by S.C Gwynne
audiobooks,"This is just a little rant I wanted to get off my chest, but I hate when there's no digital version of an audiobook available...anywhere. 

For a book club I'm part of, we have to read The Icarus Hunt by Timothy Zahn. He seems to be a fairly popular author with works in the Star Wars series, but this particular book was published in 1999, so the only audio version out there is on cassette.

I bought a hardcover off abebooks for $5 thinking it wouldn't be a big deal to read by the end of the month but I am struggling. The last physical book I read was A Court of Wings and Ruin in 2017 because they changed the narrator, and as the 3rd book in the series I couldn't deal with it at the time. Before that it was Breaking Dawn of the Twilight Series in 2008.

I learned around the time of my AP English summer reading (in 2007) that audiobooks are the best way for me to get through books, and I never looked back. I recently talked to my doctor about possibly having ADHD and she confirmed I likely have it (at age 29!) which further solidifies why audiobooks are so great for me. I usually listen on my commute to &amp; from work, or since COVID and working from home, I listen while playing some more casual video games. Staring at pages and being able to do NOTHING else at the same time drives me crazy. 

Having to actually sit down and read a book that only mildly interests me for this book club is proving to be a more frustrating experience than I anticipated. I love books for the stories they tell, but hate the physical act of reading a book (blasphemy I know) so this experience has reminded me to appreciate all of the books that do have audio, or older ones that have been digitized. They make books so much more accessible to people for a variety of reasons.

In the meantime, I'm making do with borrowing the ebook from my library and reading on my phone until I fall asleep. At least then I'm too tired to want to do anything else ;)"

Yay or nay?"
audiobooks,"I have been using apple books to listen to audiobooks and it has been working fine. However recently, I am noticing audiobooks out of order when listening on iphone, but in order when listening on my mac.

Has anyone else encountered this problem or a fix?"
audiobooks," I remember when I first came across the idea of audiobooks. I was in 4th I guess (around 9-10 yrs old). As an Indian, english isn't my first language, it is second, you may even call it third. Yeah, I know four languages (Marathi, Hindi, English, and Gujrati). Lot of Indians know atleast 3 languages. 

I was close to my english teacher as I was a 'decent' and interactive student then. I wanted to improve my accent and also be able to understand foreign accents much easily, so my teacher recommended me to listen to audiobooks instead of reading books. I didn't pay attention to her advice and instead, started watching TV shows. Foolish me preferred google's advice over that of my teacher's (But, it helped though)

I again considered listening to them when I was in 8th. I had never listened to an audiobook in my life, not even a sample. I just thought of it once when my teacher mentioned it few years back from then. 
Google Assistant had recently launched, and I was excited as Android was finally getting a personal assistant like IOS. And foolishly, without even checking, I thought that audiobooks are for blind people who can't read and that it will be narrated by Google TTS Voice, same as google assistant. So again, I gave up the idea of listening to audiobooks!

It was last year, that I got into audiobooks. It was a break and my friend was sitting alone on first bench in the class with her earphones on. I was, as usual, sitting at the back with my friends, enjoying, as if we had no other jobs in our life. I called her to join us. She didn't respond. I called her second time and she still didn't respond. So I got up and walked towards her to see what was up with her. I went, sat beside her, removed a earphone from her ear and put it in mine. She wasn't listening a song. In just few seconds I knew that it was a paragraph from Harry Potter. I listened for few more minutes, then I picked her phone up, and saw the cover on her lockscreen saying, ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, read by Stephen Fry"". I listened for few more minutes and then removed the other earphone from her ear, took her phone, left the class and went to the washroom and kept listening until my school was over (Bunked all other classes for the day). From then onwards, we both started listening to fixed number of chapters everyday and usually completed a book within a week. Now, she is my girlfriend and we both turned 18 last month."

I've tried several solutions (rainbowcrack, inaudible, AAX2MP3, etc) but I can't seem to get the code to show up. I tried replacing the missing bytes with someone's code they posted on a forum, but it did not work.

I've listened and read a decent amount of books in this genre but I've just finished Realm Slayer by  David Guymer and really enjoyed it.

I'm looking for books that have individual voices or the narrator does a good job. I believe they are called graphic, full cast or dramatized audio books.

History, but I don't want to get angry from it.

Sociology/speech forensics-but not self help.

For reference, I enjoy fantasy, sci-fi, mystery, suspense, comedy, and crime fiction if it's about solving the crime and not graphic. My favorite series are Skyward and The Naturalist. Mistborn bored me to death so I returned it and I'm working on The Way of Kings currently which is keeping my interest so far.

audiobooks,"Over the last few years narrators such as RC Bray or Scott Aeylo have started saying “wing-ed” instead of “winged”.

Is it only driving me nuts?"
audiobooks,"I'm having trouble finding new fantasy books to listen to. I've listened to most of the recommendations I see commonly on this sub. 

I tend to enjoy darker/grittier books, but would be interested in things which aren't grimdark. I have not liked any of the litRPG I've tried, but am open minded about the genre. I also try to avoid unfinished series, or series without at least two books out. I avoid anything narrated by Stephen Brand, which is unfortunate because I think he narrated some good books. Also, I'm only interested in books available as audio.

Below is a list of what I've read. I included some quick thoughts about some of them.

* Farseer - Robin Hobb. I enjoyed the first trilogy although I found it pretty slow paced. I'll probably listen to the Tawny Man trilogy but am not in a rush
* Greatcoats - Sebastien de Castell. Fun listen, I enjoyed the sword fighting scenes. Overall found it pretty average though
* The Dagger and the Coin - Pete Bradbury. Good concept, felt like a lot of filler, I wouldn't recommend it
* Dawn of Wonder - Jonathan Renshaw
* Broken Empire - Mark Lawrence. Has some flaws, but it's probably my favorite series on this list.
* The Goblin Empire - Katherine Addison. I tend to avoid books not part of the series, but really enjoyed this one.
* The Demon Cycle - Peter Brett. Painted Man is one of my favorite fantasy books, but I struggled to finish book 4 and haven't attempted the 5th.
* The Cycle of Arawn - Edward Robertson. Didn't finish, mostly stuck with it for Tim Gerard Reynolds
* Powder Mage - Brian McClellan
* Drizzt books - I really enjoyed these, read about 10 of them
* Bridei - by Juliet Mariller. I wish there were more things narrated by Michael Page
* The Magicians
* Grimnoir Chronicles - Larry Correia. Great concept, sort of an alt-history + xmen situation, although I didn't think the writing was great.
* The Lions of Al-Rassan - Guy Gavriel Kay
* The Winter King - Bernard Conwell. I enjoyed this way more than I expected, I tend to get bored with historical fiction. I'll probably check out other books by Cornwell
* Raven's Mark series - Ed Mcdonald. These were great, very reminiscent of Black Company. Colin Mace is probably my favorite narrator, he's really good
* Acts of Caine - Matthew Stover. I really enjoyed these. Very unique with great narration
* some of the Paladin Trilogy - Daniel M Ford. I wanted to like these as I love Michael Kramer, and this story has a classic feel to it. I lost interest during the second book.
* some of the King's Dark Tidings - around book 2 I decided I strongly disliked these
* some of the River of London series - I feel like I would like Urban fantasy, and enjoyed these for a while but lost interest
* some of the Dresden Files - Another urban fantasy attempt, also lost interest. Still suspect I should try other urban fantasy
* some of the Witcher series
* some of the Drenai series  
* Gentleman Bastards series
* Name of the Wind series
* Game of Thrones series
* most books by Brandon Sanderson and Joe Abercrombie
* Lightbringer series
* most of the Wheel of time
* most of the Malazan series  
* most of the Black Company series 
* Riyria series"

audiobooks,"I find the quote ""*We read to know* that we are *not alone""* thought-provoking: eg Reading allows me to feel more (or less) connected to peoples, ideologies and places, but do I read for those reasons?

Any thoughts ...?

Oh also if someone knows the differences between them I'd very much like to know that as well, if it's just different voices or if there is something else. Thank you in advance!"

audiobooks,"Edit: Rivers of London is the actual series name! 

I haven’t seen much discussion about this urban fantasy series on this subreddit, even though the Dresden Files are so widely loved here. 

I found this series while looking for books set in London but quickly realised how similar these are to the Dresden files. I’m currently on the third book and looking to move onto the fourth next. 

The magic is more subtle and grounded, but the weird and magical London Underground is just behind a locked door or block of flats. Very much reminds me of some of Gaiman’s work - especially Neverwhere. 

Kobna Holdbrook-Smith as narrator is fantastic. The differences in his characters are extremely distinct - especially in the posh accented character Nightingale. 

I think the quality is right up there with The Dresden Files (unlike the first Iron Druid audiobook I listened to) and think these deserve a discussion here and exposure to a wider audience!"

Some examples of the style of story I'm wanting are the Will Smith movie I am Legend or the video game Days Gone.

The stories are fantasy stories for now, (elves, dragons, knights kind of fantasy) and draw inspiration from movies and film that are not in the fantasy genre. The videos and their stories are original and written by me. I am trying to keep each story to under 30 minutes, so they are reasonable to listen to while working, driving, or cleaning.

So I really enjoyed this series and was looking forward to the last book. It was everything I hoped for and continued the great world building and storytelling Scalzi has been doing through the series. 

At one point I realised there was only an hour or so left in the book and I thought “dang, there’s a lot of loops to close in an hour”. Then bang, quite literally, it ended. Cardenia dead, Nadashe’s coronation foiled, Marce can manipulate the Flow, everyone planning to go to End with no resolution to the “cant support everyone” arc, the Claremont family and Nafashe’s brother? It’s like John Scalzi just got bored of writing and hastily chucked an end together, or his printer was running out of ink, or... goddamit, I don’t know. 

I’m really bummed, I reckon there was another book’s worth of closure or at least a few hundred pages. I haven’t felt as unsatisfied with a story since reading Micro but that story’s issues were for a quite different reason (RIP Mr Crichton). 

This is the first one of Scalzi’s books, short stories or anthologies I’ve been disappointed in. 

Anyway, that’s my rant over."

 books out there but I'm after the ones set before impending doom. I'm talking about Seven Eve's and The last policeman, and the likes.

What are your choices?"
audiobooks,"I am hoping to find something from the perspective of a reasonable adult or very intelligent teen that is learning about making friends and how to be a good friend. I prefer fiction, usually in the fantasy or sci-fi genre but I have come across a few non-fictions in the past. 

I prefer the main character not become romantically involved and focus more on the friendships but I can deal if it is not erotic and just romantic. I don't really care if secondary characters have their relationship and MC is just a third wheel. 

I am very welcoming to non-human MC's as well. I enjoy adventures and interpersonal relationships of people from different backgrounds finding common ground and forging a good friendship. 

I am hoping for something newer, probably post internet and don't mind more amateuristic writing or even stories closer to the level of fan fiction. I've found most classics are lost on me and hope there are more esoteric authors or even subgenres that write fun stories and don't take themselves too seriously.

Hopefully with a narrator that is able to do a variety of voices but I will settle as long as they actually give inflections instead of reading everything in a monotone. If you had fun listening to the story then I expect I might as well."

Surrender, or face the consequences.

That’s the message that gets delivered to Meadowcity the day sixteen-year-old adventurer Sylvia Thorne comes home from her travels throughout the Four Cities. 

And the enemy won’t stop until he gets what he wants. Governor Sorin Greyling of Skycity has come a long way in the five years since he made a dark discovery about the Four Cities, and he’s willing to risk everything he values to bring his discovery to light.

Amidst a world of fantastical cities, dangerous creatures, and advanced technology that feels like magic, Sylvia must find a way to protect Meadowcity from Greyling, before the war reaches her home.  But when Sylvia gets in Sorin’s way, it could mean the end of Meadowcity.

Told in two timelines that meet with one big discovery, the first book in this young-adult sci-fi/fantasy trilogy paints a fantastical balance of bravery, love, adventure, and coming of age."
audiobooks,"I am obsessed with self improvement and philosophical books, and have read all kinds - from A New Earth (my very favorite) and spiritual books like that or Abraham Hicks to The Undefeated Mind, Atomic Habits, Grit, The Road Less Travelled, you name it. 

I’m looking to find a good book for my SO and I to listen to together on a road trip, but he is very picky about the type of self-improvement books he likes and I have a very difficult time correctly predicting what he’ll like. 

Books he’s really enjoyed: The Road Less Travelled by M Scott Peck and A New Earth by Eckhart Tolle (this is his very favorite which surprised me)

Book he hasn’t been thrilled by: Grit, The Undefeated Mind, Unf*ck Yourself, and anything very “woo woo” spiritual positivity kind of thing.

My general assumption is that he likes things that drop a lot of “truth bombs” without being overly passionate, syrupy-positive, or too “dry” (I think Grit might have been a little too evidence-based sciencey for his taste). 

Any suggestions for my very picky SO?? He is definitely interested in self improvement and philosophy, he just doesn’t really know what he likes until he reads/hears it. TIA!!"
audiobooks,"I grew up on them and loved them, but i cant find them anywhere. Its a massive shame. 

Anyone know where i might be able to find them?"
audiobooks,"Just wanted to express my love for audiobooks! Growing up, I was never much of a reader. I always read slow and it was hard for me to pay attention to letters on paper. In college, I never read textbooks because of my reading difficulties and relied on listening to recorded lectures. I remember trying to get into audiobooks back then but the selections weren't large enough to capture my interest nor did I have the money to afford them. A couple of weeks ago, I went back to trying out audiobooks and have already listened to 7 books! More than one a week! I've never been able to absorb that much book material in such a short amount of time in my life. So happy that I am finally able to dive into books!

&amp;#x200B;

Now if only I could find something similar for scientific papers, haha."

audiobooks,"I saw somewhere today that the folks who enjoy audible in the UK can pick up an all time favorite of mine for $3!  Red Rising is the first in a sci fi fantasy trilogy which is also followed by another trilogy that just got its fifth book. I enjoyed all of these audio books more than I can say, and Tim Gerard Reynolds is by far my favorite narrator I’ve heard for audio books (the guy who does IT was really good too). Check it out if you can!"

Any suggestions will be received with open arms, thanks."
audiobooks,"I am so glad I stumbled upon this gorup.  The first post I read sounded just like me.  An ""I hate to read"" post...and I couldn't agree more.  I never had the patience or, lets face it, the attention span.  I'd get all ADD'd out in my head and start re-writing it in my mind.  Audiobooks seem to keep my focused and interested.  I am sure there's a diagnosis or term, besides be auditory or visual, etc....funny thing is, I am now a ""writer"" blogger/vlogger creature....and love it.  But i'd never read me either....so I finally got someone to put first book on Audible.  If I could only ""read"" all my blogs...i'd follow me.  I think that's a pod cast...anyway.  Looking forward to awesome suggestions and new discoveries.  I am good for 2-3 a week now that I am avid ""listener."""

audiobooks,"I was hoping to find an audiobook history of the Romani people (Romany, Roma, Gypsies...). I would settle for a history book where they're only a small part, if had good information and the rest was interesting.

[Libro.fm](https://Libro.fm) has a book called ""**The Roma: The History of the Romani People and the Controversial Persecutions of Them across Europe""** which seems like what I would want, except that it's only 1.5 hours and the author is listed as ""Charles River Editors"" which seems to just pump out short audiobooks and ebooks. Does anybody have an opinion about Charles river editors or this book?"

audiobooks,"The incredible Mark Boyett narrated my After the Galaxy series, which you can [check out here.](https://www.audible.com/series/After-the-Galaxy-Audiobooks/B07QH85V9Z)

I have a very limited number of download codes to give away for the full series.

**It's first-come, first-served.**

If you checked out the link and liked what you saw...

...comment below and **tell me if you need a code for US or UK**

(Audible doesn't offer codes outside of US and UK sadly.)

Note - the idea with these codes is that you'll leave a review after listening. This is so I stay in compliance with Audible's Conditions of Use. To comply with the rules of this subreddit: I'm the author of this series, in case it wasn't clear. :P

Thank you for your support. :)

**UPDATE:** I still have UK codes, and I'm going to try to get more US codes. If you're in the US and interested in the series, feel free to comment for a code. If I get more I'll send them out here, again on a first-come first-served basis."
audiobooks,"I want to learn sound design for narrative works of fiction that use a music bed and sound effects. I'm not a consumer of this genre; it's a little different from what I do enjoy, which is audio dramas.

By sheer dumb luck, yesterdat I discovered William Shatner narrates his Star Trek novels in the format I'm looking for, but I'm wondering if there are better examples out there that I can deconstruct.

Can anyone recommend any narrated fictional audiobooks (or podcasts) that have a music bed and sound effects that are executed well from a technical standpoint? Where the extra fluff actually accentuates the story rather than getting in the way of it.

So something long the lines of this, but perhaps done a different way, or a different genre of fiction.

audiobooks,"I read many good reviews on Oryx and Crake, so I purchased it about 1.5 years ago.  However, after about 5 different attempts to listen to it I've given up. I'm not sure if the narration gets better after the first few chapters, but in my limited audiobook experience, this is the most dry/bland narration I've come across.  I cannot for the life of me get past it. How do you guys overcome terrible narration. The books seems really interesting otherwise."
audiobooks,"I have a new audiobook release that I've narrated! Eric Danhoff's REVENANT SUN is a cyberpunk noire that has incredible world building and some great characters. 

*Imagine a place where improving your mind and body through augmentation is the key to success. this is where Stanley Gabrels is from; a journalist hard wired to the very data stream he posts articles to. A society obsessed only with cutting edge technology, with every bit of information, culture and art at their fingertips, broadcast directly into their brain via Adam, an advanced artificial intelligence designed to oversee its users and streamline life itself. Those who can't afford such improvements live beneath the fury, in forgotten streets that siphon what they can from above to survive. the day after a wanted criminal is killed in those streets, Gabrels begins to experience strange dreams, alarming changes in behavior. As his mind deteriorates, Gabrels begins to realize someone else is inside his mind with him, fighting for control. Can he regain himself from the man inside who is slowly tearing his life apart? Who is responsible for this in a city where your every move is monitored?*

I don't know if its relevant but I don't mind what type of demons, be it the supernatural walking humanoid ones or the demon cycle monster-type ones I'll take pretty much anything. I am also a big fan of the Dresden files and almost sadly done with the adventures of Harry so a series would come in nicely. I'd also be fine with an angel vs demon war or something of the like since I've rarely seen angels in these books. I'm also a fan of the iron druid if it matters much, but as with the witcher and Dresden, I haven't finished those books yet either. Thanks in advance I've always gotten lovely recommendations from this sub and look forward to it this time again.

audiobooks,I like to listen to audiobooks that are uplifting and have a good message. Anyone listen to anything they just loved and felt was life-changing. Can be anything doesn't have to be personal development. I loved the Alchemist! Are there any Podcasts about Audiobooks that you like?
audiobooks,"I have many audiobooks on audible that I have purchased to listen to because I have bad short range vision. I often see bookshelves in people houses that make for great decorations. It must feel very great to see and feel the books you have read as tangible objects. I have recently started purchasing a few of the physical copies of books I own(with no intention if re-reading), but in a small amount they look downright embarassing. It turns out to be at a mammoth of a cost to purchase the remainder. I was wondering if someone has been in this position before and has a good solution. It does not feel the same to scroll through an audible library. I looked into just buying the book covers only, but this does not appear to exist as a service."
audiobooks,Can someone please suggest an easy comfort read! Just finished the stationery shop of Tehran and loved it! It’s a love story of sorts  narrated against the backdrop of the Iranian revolution !

audiobooks,"Just want to give a shout out to one of my favorite audiobooks! I have listened to it front to back a few times over the years, and pick up my hard copy version to read little passages when the mood strikes. Just started it again, and listen to it on my way to and from working out in the morning. It really sets the tone for the day, reminds me of what’s important, and inspires me with the sense that all I need truly exists within me."

Im looking for a good history audio book that isn’t dreadful to listen to. Most of the time I try to listen to history audio books the reader puts me to sleep. 

I think history is so fun and interesting and I wish a narrator could show that enthusiasm as well. I’m interested in any type of history. I like to learn about war and ancient civilizations. 

Thanks!"

You seriously don't want to miss out on getting this one for free, bruh.

audiobooks,"Hello. So I've wanting to write a little short story recently that could fit into one of my favorite series, but it would involve aspects of military/rebellious factions. While I may have a broad basic understanding, I would love to find a audio book that dove into the the little details of how such a organization works. Something modern-ish. I looked through Audible's selection of military books but I wasn't sure which ones glance over details and which ones dived in and explained.

So any recommendations? If so I'd appreciate it. Thanks!"
audiobooks,"Do you believe that racism isn’t a problem in Canada, or that it’s a relatively benign issue compared to racism in the United States, or other countries? If so, Desmond Cole may change your mind. Cole’s stories about his personal experience of anti-Black racism made me uncomfortable at times, but that’s a good thing. I felt compelled to reflect much more critically on my previous assumptions about where I live, Toronto, and its supposed multi-cultural, post-racial ideals.

The books are narrated by Philip Battley. They've been described as hilarious, whimsical, and somewhat dark. Because the novels do tend to get darker as the series progresses, these books are best suited for teens (13+) and adults.

If you enjoy Neil Gaiman, Douglas Adams, Lemony Snicket, or darker fables like A Monster Calls or The Book of Lost Things, then you might just like these.

US/UK codes are available, but I only have a limited number of each, so feel free to contact me if you’re interested.

 **The Sky Realms Online Books 1-3 Box Set is 30+ hours of epic LitRPG adventure set in a virtual world where anything can happen... maybe even death.** 

Hall had played the VRMMORPG, Sky Realms Online, since beta. During one gaming session, a freak accident traps Hall and other players in the game. They awaken to find out their bodies are comatose and they have been downloaded fully into the virtual world. Even worse, the rules have changed, they've been forced back to level 1, and permadeath might be possible.

Join Hall and his growing circle of friends and enemies, both Players and NPCs, as they discover that Sky Realms Online is not the same game they knew. New lands, new foes, and new mysteries.

**Grayhold (Book 1)**: Hall finds himself trapped in the game world, but not the game that he remembered. Things have changed. Hall gets his first quests, meets his first friends, and finds what could be his future home.

**Silverpeak (Book 2)**: Now the Lord of a ruined village, Hall takes his first steps toward turning Skara Brae into a real village. A journey to the city of Silver Peak Keep involves Hall and friends in a war between guilds.

**Axestorm (Book 3)**: Skara Brae is growing and it's time to take the next step. Hall and companions journey to the Dwarf fortress of Axestorm Hall in search of an airship. There they encounter more mysteries and another Player, Iron, who is working to conqueror the entire island of Huntley.  

**Grab this special edition box set today and dive headfirst into the action-packed world of Sky Realms Online.  It's a LitRPG saga perfect for fans of J.A. Hunter, Dakota Krout, and Edward Brody.**"
audiobooks,"I am the author of *Falling Up: 9 Ways to Transform Trauma into Triumph* written under the pen name Tasha Brooks (real name: Dhana Kannan). In 2015, I was diagnosed with thyroid cancer and the same year I started my PhD program while still recovering from the illness. At the time, I was struggling with my health and other personal and professional setbacks. I was looking for books to cope with trauma, and while I found many motivational books, I did not find a practical, actionable handbook—so I wrote one. For years, I went back and forth on whether I should just keep it as my personal notes or publish it. Then in 2018, my cancer came back and I underwent treatment last year. While undergoing treatment a second time, I finally decided to update the book and get it ready for publication. I’m grateful that I am doing well health-wise now and also went on to complete my PhD.

The audiobook is one hour long. The techniques in this book are backed by research and have tremendously helped me. Although the book has a few instances from my life, the primary focus of the book is on coping and thriving after trauma.

The audiobook is widely available (e.g.: Audible, Amazon, Google Play, Kobo etc.) I have audiobook codes for US, Canada, Australia, UK, and EU. Message me if you are interested in listening to this audiobook and I’ll send you a code. The code needs to be redeemed here: [https://authors-direct.com/redeem/](https://authors-direct.com/redeem/). You can also ask for the audiobook in your public libraries and get it for free.

My goal in putting this book out in the world is that it can help others build a more optimistic future, as it did for me. This book helped me heal, and if you are struggling, I truly hope that it can do the same for you.

Thank you so much for your time."
audiobooks,"Ok so because of all you guys I am now listening to the Bobiverse series. Very much enjoying myself. Before that, it was World War Z. These books would have never made it to my wishlist if it wasn’t for you guys in r/audiobooks. It just never occurred to me that zombies or science fiction could be fun for me - even intellectually entertaining. I’ve listened to historical novels, romantic and or literary ones before. Because if the ‘tips based on your library’ with audible, I was glued to the same genres. Until reddit came along and helped me find some great books which I’d never have found by myself. 

I am very grateful to all of you, for opening up new worlds! My wishlist is full of more undiscovered gems!"

audiobooks,"Hi,

I'm looking for (audio) book suggestions, would be awesome if they were available on Audible.

About 2-3 years ago, I was heavily addicted to drugs, attempted to take my life countless times, had to spend a total of 4 weeks in the mental hospital, moved 8 times in a span of 3 years etc.

All of this left me in a very odd place in my life, where I feel like I'm constantly disturbed by my own thoughts and feel like I'm running from myself. I feel like things do have gotten a little better, but I'm still at this place, where I'm kind of fighting myself and the things that I do or think.

I think what would really help me, was some good audio books, that help guide my mind for the best me, that I really want to be. Since I can't really be bothered to work on myself using ""regular"" methods, like breathing exercises, meditation, therapy or whatsoever, having a fairly busy life and low energy, motivation and bad life circumstances, I was wondering if there's a book that might give me a little push and take my mind off some of the negative stuff or convert it into positive.

What I ideally look for, is something  that has a little bit of dreamy/fantasy element to it, but that would also keep me grounded and focused in the real world, since I do work as a software developer.

It would also be awesome, if it was an inspiring story and something that possibly educates me a little on life matters, and that helps progress in this fast-paced ""modern world"" that we live in.

&amp;#x200B;

I will see through every suggestion, and I thank you for taking your time to read this post.

Thanks!"

In the summer of 1851, Nathaniel Hawthorne finally had enough financial stability from his writing to make it his sole income. His family moved to sleepy Lenox, Massachusetts, during which time his wife and daughters took an extended trip back to Boston. Hawthorne was left as the primary caregiver of 5-year-old Julian, while also trying to work from home.

Other family members mentioned include:

* Phoebe - Hawthorne's nickname for his wife, Sophia, who was a skilled painter.
* Una - Their eldest daughter, 7-years-old at this time.
* Rose - Their youngest child, an infant.
* E.P.P. - Sophia's sister, Elizabeth. She promoted early childhood education in the USA, introducing kindergarten to the country, and was also an important figure in the transcendentalist movement.
* Mrs Mann - Sophia's sister, Mary. She was an educator, and also helped her husband promote public education and her sister's efforts to introduce early childhood education into America."
audiobooks,"Is there an app out there that lets you rename chapter titles in m4b files? Currently, the only way I know to achieve this is to split the m4b into separate mp3s, and then recombine them back to an m4b (and name the chapters there). It seems like there must be an easier way. As far as I can tell, however, all the id3 tag apps I’ve tried have no way of viewing/editing chapter marks/titles."
audiobooks,"I've recently published the Aesop Player (for Android). It's completely free, and ad-free. (I derive no revenue from it.) I created it for a relative who wanted to listen to books, but couldn't use the usual smart phone touchscreen (even with the usual accessibility interfaces) and couldn't manage changing CDs or juggling a large device.

For example, one of the UI actions for starting/stopping the book is flipping the whole phone or tablet face down to stop, and back up to continue. Book titles are displayed in a giant font, and announced audibly. It can be configured to be very ""fumble-proof"" so users who have problems managing objects won't accidentally get themselves into an unusable state. Both volume and speed can be set without having to look at the screen.

It's a book player, focused on books, not a music player that happens to play books.  It will back up a selectable amount and reread a bit after stopping to get back into the context. Books are seen as a single entity; it takes care of issues such as chapters being in separate files. (Even a book of books such as War and Peace.) There are a number of other features that allow you to adapt it to a range of usage styles.

It's designed to be able to work with remote access software so it is possible to add or remove books and configure it remotely.  The documentation includes instructions for installing books from Librivox and similar sites, and also how to install library books from various sources that allow that if you have a library account. It tracks book position, and remembers if the book has been played to the end so it's not necessary to guess about that.

Even if you aren't interested for yourself, you may have a friend or relative that can't easily use audio books with conventional players. This may work for them.

Drop by Play Store ([https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=github.io.donnKey.aesopPlayer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=github.io.donnKey.aesopPlayer)) to try it, or  [https://donnkey.github.io/aesopPlayer/index.html](https://donnkey.github.io/aesopPlayer/index.html) for a demo video and extensive documentation."

audiobooks,"Here's a [link to an Airtable base](https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=inv2xn09Ua1mvq7c2&amp;) I made to keep track of the audio books I've read.  Airtable is a free\* app/site that lets you make these glorified spreadsheets.  This one I'm sharing will let you list lots of information about each title, including the author, narrator, your ratings for the book and the narrator, when you started it, whether you finished it, whether you've read it in print, where you got it, any notes you want to put, and a picture of the cover.  I included a tab for your queue, as well as one for sources.

Keeping track of sources is the main reason I started this thing, because after a while, it becomes hard to remember where I got a particular book, especially since I'm a member of several different libraries, plus Audible.

The link will give you a read-only version, but you can save it to your own Airtable account and make any changes you wish.  You'll need to make an account if you don't have one.  Airtable has apps for Android and Apple, and they work fine, but if you have a lot of records to add, it's easier to do with a proper keyboard.

If you have any questions about how to use this, please post them here, and I'll try to help.  If you happen to know of a record-keeping app that works better, I'll probably ditch this in a heartbeat, but for now, this is what is working for me.

&amp;#x200B;

audiobooks,"As a book addict who used to HATE reading more than anything but just like a 4 years old who had to eat his veggies to grow bigger and stronger, it took me time to get used to liking reading and making it a daily habit I was pondering an idea:

What do I need now or could’ve needed to get me to like reading and/or absorbing the necessary knowledge efficiently and fast?

I narrowed down the possible ideas into creating a youtube channel, and “yeah here we go, just another youtube channel” was the first thing that popped into my mind.

I’m aware there are be a lot of channels doing the exact same thing which is the reason I’m writing this.

And because quality content, true value, and a unique proposition are the most important aspects, there was no better idea than asking the audience themselves.

So if you could just brainstorm random ideas you wish could be present now but aren’t, things existing channels are doing that need improvement, things that already exist but there should be more off, etc.

For example one of the first things that came into my mind is that most people I’ve seen present amazing information, but since books, knowledge and information are considered “serious matters”, they take it very seriously as well.

So if there’s room for adding some more light, different video formatting, maybe some memes every now and then (all in context of course) – it could add an additional dosage of entertainment that isn’t too present in most books.

The answers to this post will probably be the main factor of determining whether I go on with this or not because if I’m not going to bring value or differentiate myself then there’s no need to make “just another channel”

If you’ve read this far then thank you! I appreciate it a lot and I hope you can brainstorm some ideas and give your opinion on whether it’s worth going for in the first place or not."

audiobooks,"r/audiobooks,

In honor of my first book going live on Audible, I’ve decided to repay some of the kindness I’ve received from many of the fine folk in this sub over the years in the form of US and UK promo codes! *Slab Steele and the Venusian Exchange* is the first installment in the Worlds of Craterball series. The second installment, *Slab Steele and the Outer Rim Job*, will hopefully be out by the end of the year, with an audiobook to follow shortly.

*Slab Steele was once the hottest craterback prospect coming out of Texas Space University, but a series of self-engineered screw ups have left him without the hope of joining the greatest craterback to ever play the game, Mirt “The Whip” Ballfeather, in the Craterball Hall of Fame.*  

*Once reduced to playing backup for the worst team in the league, the Venus Flytrap, Slab has finally got his life back on track. Slab Steele - through no significant achievement of his own - is on the verge of winning the Crater Bowl. On the eve of the biggest match of his life, the deciding Match Seven of the Solar Craterball Finals, Slab Steele is knocked out and taken captive by two die-hard fans of the rival team. There’s only one problem: Slab isn’t even the starter.* 

*Suddenly, Slab Steele is thrust into an adventure that forces him to confront a ghost from his past, meet a hero from his present, and ultimately come to terms with a future unlike any he has ever known, all while trying to make it to Venus in time for the Crater Bowl.*

audiobooks,"Hey everyone!  I know a lot of us probably think about politics a lot these days so I decided to offer up my favorite Political Comedy Audiobook.  It has the distinction of being one of those books that actually holds up better in audio.

WHY NOT ME? by Al Franken.  I believe it is still available on Audible.  It is all about the campaign between Al Franken and Al Gore.  It is irreverent, hilarious, and just plain great.  

Example: Franken says he wants to get rid of Saddam Hussien (yes, its an older book) single-handedly by offering him a plaque for being the ""worlds greatest grandpa"" and bludgeoning him with it.

Genre wise I'm very open. I'm just looking for something that's easy to listen to while driving long distances and won't get too confusing/make me have to re-listen.

I own an amazon kindle device. I used to read books on it almost every day until recently I discovered the comfort and power of an audiobook. I am so hooked to the idea of an audiobook as I could listen to it while in bed at night without stressing my eyes.

I am on a budget and not sure if going with an on-demand service like audible will fit me in the long run. I find it quite good but a bit overpriced IMO. So, I thought using a text to speech application (Android-based) would be a good idea. 

What mobile application for text to speech conversion would you recommend? Features I am looking for: voice to feel more natural, option to bookmark, simple. It would be nice if the app is FOSS. Thanks."

On the other side - it is said - lies paradise. But no one ever came back…

This nine part series follows six wanderers on their ways to the stream, searching for a better life on the other side.

audiobooks,"I just wanted to share with the audiobook community an audio drama podcast from the CBC (which is Canada's national broadcaster). The episodes are much like audiobooks but with foley, music and more. PlayME has just released all three parts of Cowgirl Up by Anna Chatterton and I wanted to get the word out.

[www.cbc.ca/playmeCBC](https://www.cbc.ca/playmeCBC)

Episode - The Show Must Go On: ""Cowgirl Up"" (Part 1)  
All three parts available to binge right now!

Here's a synopsis:  
Joyce, Effie and BB are cowgirl goddesses on Mount Olympus who lament  what they see down on earth.  It’s a cowboy’s world. Cocky steer-ropers have stolen the spotlight for long enough. The goddesses decide to use  their considerable supernatural powers to give rise to a Cowgirl Revolution. When they discover Cassidy Clark, a talented, charismatic loner from Okotoks, Alberta, they know they have found the barrel racer poised to lead their cause. The three goddesses appear to her one day,  offering her all the gifts she will need to earn her first buckle at the  Canadian Finals Rodeo championship. We follow Cassidy atop her trusty mare, Starbright, as she rises to the top of the circuit, throwing back shots of Jack Daniels and two-stepping along the way. Cassidy wrestles with her new-found fame, and just how far she will push herself and Starbright in pursuit of their dream.

It's a beautiful story, deeply rooted in the Canadian Rodeo scene, with a magical, fantastical twist.

Full disclosure: I'm one of the producers of the show at the CBC. It's free to listen, and family-friendly. The Show Must Go On Series is an initiative to give life to cancelled theatre productions due to COVID-19, and to keep actors, playwrights, and arts workers working during the shutdowns - I hope to be able to share this piece with others."

I love adventure movies where they discover new lands and treasures and such, like the old Disney movie ""Atlantis"" for example.

I also loved the movie ""Treasure Planet"", also an old Disney movie.

I love the idea of mythical beings and unnatural things.

audiobooks,"Hello, good people!

Let me apologize in advance if this is the sort of post you get all the time; I did quite a bit of research by myself, discussed it over at r/Fantasy, and in a recent discussion, I was advised to come and ask you here! I also read the FAQ, but didn't find my answers, so here I am. I want to know what the users can tell me of their apps from experience, 'cause I find you can never tell if the service is going to be as advertized in big bold letters, can you?

So here goes the thing: I currently have Downpour, but am not really satisfied with it: it was supposed to be possible to borrow books DRM-free and return them after a period of time, which I found cool. However, none of the books on my list are available to borrow! (Arrrrrr, frustration!) Add to that the fact that some books cost more that your monthly credit, and you'll understand my lack of satisfaction. I'm keeping it at the moment because it seems to be one of the few apps that have the series I'm currently on, in unabridged version. 

BUT, I mean to switch as soon as I'm through with it, and that's where you come in, if you would be so kind!

Here are my criterias:

\- Has to be available off-line

\- Not too expensive, as I use audiobook format to get through my physical books faster. I don't really want to buy every book twice! It can absolutely be DRM-free!

\- I don't live in the US, and we don't have a system of public libraries with Overdrive for example, so that doesn't work

\- Aaaaaand, I refuse to give my money to Amazon, so that rules Audible out.

Phew! Does anything still exist for me in spite of all this? *Clasps hands and opens big, round, lovely Puss-y eyes*"
audiobooks,"&amp;#x200B;

I’m looking for help finding a new portable audio player/unit to purchase for my **Audiobooks** and **Lecture Series**.

I would love the input from people who are more seasoned with DAP units than I am.

&amp;#x200B;

# Things to know:

* I’m on a Mac
* It must have a bookmarking function OR, at the very least, a ‘resume’ function
* I need to be able to expand the memory to 2TB
* Bluetooth is a necessity
* Touchscreen is a necessity
* Physical Size of the unit must be manageable. **I** currently **have a HIDIZS AP80** . **It’s** awesome but it’s too small for me to work the progress slider when I return to an audiobook or lecture. It lacks an intuitive resume or pause option so I have to manually move the slider to where I last ended and the screen is **simply** **too** **small** for me to manage this without great difficulty.
* File Types - I really need it to be able to recognize MP3, WAV, FLAC, APE, WMA, MP4, and if possible, m4b
* Spotify Integration would be great. I have never used a portable unit with this capability but I've been reading about it and would be interested in a unit that can do this.
* Price Range - I’d like to stay **under $200**

&amp;#x200B;

# My concerns:

* Playlists - how easy or difficult it is to create a Playlist, as well as how many playlists the unit allows
* How many songs/files the unit can hold 
* WiFi - I would like it to have WiFi
* FM Radio - I would like it to have an FM radio
* Battery Life - I’d like it to last all day, if possible.
* Video - it would be great if it played video but it’s not necessary.  I have iPods. I want to get away from Apple and Cell Phone type devices.  Podcasts - it would be great to be able to play Podcasts easily with the unit
* UI - it would be nice to find a unit with a really smooth, fast, and intuitive UI.Support - Again, it would be great if the company selling/making the unit has a strong customer support presence, but if there are active user forums out there for the unit I’d be A-OK with using that in place of customer support (so long as the discussions are healthy and up to date).

&amp;#x200B;

I’m currently entertaining the possibility of the **Sony NW-A45/B Walkman** with Hi-Res Audio. And the **FiiO M6 Hi Res Lossless** but I’d really like to hear from more seasoned DAP owners what your preferences might be and what you consider the Pro’s and Con’s of your suggested units.

Anyways, I'd like to keep developing it and to add features in the future such as:

\-Bookmarks

\-Syncing book location/bookmark data with the cloud

\-Storing and being able to play your books from the cloud (kinda like Plex)

\-Ebook support

\-Goodreads support to allowing rating a book within the app

I work mostly 50 hour weeks and literally can listen to my earphones for a good 8 hours a night so I got all the time in the world to learn something, got a lot of stuff on Roman history, world war 2 stories, self help stuff and just getting into philosophy, the ideal thing would be something that I could use towards a new/better job but god knows what that would be.

audiobooks,Looking for some thriller books with good narration.
audiobooks,"Any audiobooks you love that don’t get the pub from this reddit?

(I like sci-fi the most, but am open to every answer)"
audiobooks,"I'm not talking about when a narrator has a different voice for every character, that's cool if the narrator is good.

But I've noticed a practice where male narrators will use the same voice for narration, male dialogue, and everything else except for female dialogue which gets a very strange airy higher pitched voice. It just comes off as very strange and distracting to me. Either use different voices for the characters or don't. 

And the canter of the voice change seems to be a constant among different narrators who do this, so it could be something taught when people get trained for voice acting/narration/radio etc."

audiobooks,I am wondering what you guys use to obtain your audiobooks. I have been using audible but also an app called Libby for library audiobooks.
audiobooks," So I posted on [r/books](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/) last week about starting this series and based on my situation, a few people suggested reading them in publication order by means of audiobook, due to my home and work schedules not giving me much free time. So this is how I've decided to dive into the Discworld (and other TP novels). I thought I'd do it properly and get an Audible account.

So I got The Colour of Magic with my free trial and - wow - the quality is absolutely abysmal. It's completely buried in tape hiss. Most of the reviews say the first few are like this. Not great from arguably the biggest audiobook service available. So I ended up looking at ""alternatives"" purely out of curiosity and nearly every ""alternative"" version I've found sounds far superior than the official version found on Audible. Why is this?

I resent paying for the privilege of experiencing the worst listening experience available when shadier methods seem to give me better results. Are there better recordings out there from other subscription services? I'm tempted to give Kobo a go but there's no point if they use the same files."

I found one called In the Valley of the Sun by Andy Davidson. Looking for a paranormal read or could be a murder horror book. Definitely something to keep the air on your neck up at night lol.

Look forward to reading the suggestions!!!

audiobooks,"Hi everyone I've been recently reading this book with heavy dialogue and would really like to hear it when I'm working but because of the heavy dialogue it makes it a bit difficult. I use an app that has a robot voice (which I don't mind) to read the text into speech. But my only problem is that I don't know when it is quoting. It would make it very helpful if it would say when a new quote started and ended. Does anyone know a text to speech that does this?

Here is an example I want it to give some type of signal when the quote starts.

2-I know someone who has a prime account in france. I have accounts for 5 different amazons (my country don't has the service).

2.a)  If i registered in every country i could profit from the first month and cancel in every one of them? Is this a good way/viable way of getting the 10+ books i want?

I listen to books through Libby (library) - just finished Bone Labyrinth by James Rollins. (I just looked to see if it stated who it was read by but it didn't)  


This was a long book and for me confusing - sometimes they'd talk about archaeology - sometimes about the taking of a very intelligent ape and handlers  


According to the description of the book there is a tie in - maybe because I only listed to this 30 min to an hour at a time over many weeks I just didn't see the tie in just a couple of chapters on one thing and some on another then back to the first  


It does have over 1200 4.5 star reviews tho"

Description: The story follows Shayna, a young member of the Seekers Sanctuary where those people with the ability to read into the memories and experiences of others - a talent called reaching -  live. The story takes place in the not so wide world of Fahrul, a city encased in constant roiling sandstorms, governed by the overbearing High Council. But is there more to the city? What lies beyond the sands? What role does the council truly play, and why is Shayna struggling to return from a recent reaching?

I am releasing the story chapter by chapter every Sunday at 3:00am for all of you early risers (or **late** sleepers). Be sure to join in on the story and listen as it unfolds in your ears!

Chapter 4 releases tomorrow morning.

audiobooks,"So I've used Voice on Android for years, but recently I decided to switch to iPhone since SE was getting great reviews and my computer and tablet are Apple as well. I saw the stickied post about the answers most people give, but it's a bit lacking since there's no pros and cons or anything, and I'm a blank slate on iOS, because the file architecture is different, right down to the fact I can't even use an SD card which is where my audiobooks went on the old phone. 

So I listen to a lot of audiobooks, but I don't think I'm needing anything too crazy, Voice was a free app, and it played all but one or two of the books I threw at it, with VLC handling the strays. I'm fine with kicking a few bucks at an app, especially a quality one, but I don't want to buy three different apps before finding one I like.

Wish list

* Can use multiple file types, mp3, m4a, CUE, and folders for audiobooks that are multiple files

* Ability to rename once they're in the app would be great

* Up to 2.5x speed

* Remember playback of multiple books at the same time

* Must be able to put audiobooks on the phone storage instead of streaming them, (they won't give me the wifi password at work which is where I do almost all my listening)

* I really like knowing either A the percentage of the way I am through the book, or B both current place and total length. I was really irritated when Voice stopped showing my current location and only showed how much was left. 

* Series sorting options would be great"

audiobooks,"Hello there r/audiobooks readers! A new BDSM/Erotica/Romance audiobook I've been working on just dropped and I'm popping in for some additional promotion.

Bounty: A Dark Romance

She thought she could get the best of me. She got my belt, instead.

After I went undercover to take down a mob boss and ended up betrayed, framed, and on the run, Harper Rollins tried to bring me in. But instead of collecting a bounty, she earned herself a hard spanking and then an even rougher lesson that left her cute bottom sore in a very different way.

She's not one to give up without a fight, but that's fine by me. It just means I'll have plenty more chances to welt her beautiful backside and then make her scream her surrender into the sheets.

Publisher's note: Bounty includes spankings and sexual scenes. If such material offends you, please don't buy this audiobook."

     So When I was little I had this CD collection called “History of the World”. I have no idea who it was written by. It was mainly about ancient history and had stories about anansi the spider and the Mesopotamian people and how they cultivated crops. I have been looking for this forever and it would mean the world to me if someone could help me find it. It was lost during the time my parents were getting divorced. After that I moved to two more houses within a year so my stuff is all over the place and I think it disappeared into the abyss. Thank you for any help you can give me!"

audiobooks,"It’s on Spotify for free btw which is why I thought it appropriate to post it here.

I don’t know if I’m listening to it wrong or what, but first of all it’s super confusing that it’s even in 3rd person at all since Lawton himself writes it. And then sometimes it switches to 1st person for example “my brother” and then even when the narrator (Lawton) is speaking, reflecting on it, he sometimes says “Larry says” after, but sometimes he just says it in first person and it’s really making it quite unpleasant to listen to.

Although I haven’t seen anybody else mention this problem so maybe I’m just not understanding the narration style or something idk."
audiobooks," I just finished writing my first omorashi book. It took me 2 years to finish it but it looks like my hard work finally paid off (:

For those who don't know ,omorashi is a Japanese fetish in which one experiences sexual arousal from watching/reading/witnessing someone desperate to pee and struggling to hold it in,eventually wetting themselves.

 It features 10 different stories in which 10 different people find themselves in desperate need for relief, trying their hardest to hang on until the very last minute. Will they make it in time &amp; avoid the public humiliation? Read to find out.

 I decided I'm just going to turn it into an audiobook, but my biggest problem right now is finding voice actors that are willing to read out loud the stuff I wrote. The descriptions are pretty explicit and raunchy. Most of the people I talked with about my fetish said that it's really gross.What if the voice actors are disgusted &amp; uncomfortable with it? Any suggestions?"

I'm curious how others deal with this. Case in point: I like the Vera TV series, so I started listening to Ann Cleeves' 1st book, The Crow Trap, which introduced the Vera character. A couple hours into it and still no Vera.

*Edit: Such varied and great responses! I read the Dune books years ago and loved them, but I bet I wouldn't have felt the same about the audiobooks. I guess for me some are better read than heard. I read Moby Dick I guess in high school, and reading it could skip some of the whaling stuff. Hard to do that with an audiobook.*

This is basically an open-source alternative for proprietary solutions like Amazon's Whispersync. The code is available on github: [https://github.com/r4victor/syncabook](https://github.com/r4victor/syncabook).

Anyone can create such an ebook and then listen to it using any reader that supports EPUB3 with Media Overlays. I use [Readium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/readium/fepbnnnkkadjhjahcafoaglimekefifl) and [Menestrello](https://www.readbeyond.it/menestrello/). Unfortunately, the former is going to be deprecated and the latter is inactive for quite a while. Please tell me if you know of other readers that support this feature.

I've developed it primarily to produce read-along ebooks for LibriVox recordings. Here is a repository containing those that have already been synchronized: [https://github.com/r4victor/synclibrivox](https://github.com/r4victor/synclibrivox).

I'd be glad to get your feedback on the project.

I would do a one off payment for software but I'm not interested in subscription based apps.

Anyone have anything to recommend?"
audiobooks,"I want to gift an audiobook player to my grandfather, who's 85 and unfortunately blind. It must have the following characteristics:

* It has a simple button interface.
* It remembers where the book was previously paused.
* It requires no access to the Internet.
* Additionally, if possible, it's not too expensive.

I've been searching for such product for quite a time without any success so far. If there's anyone who is familiar with a player of this sort, I'd be grateful if you told me.

Which are the best choices of an audiobook player for a blind elderly person with said characteristics?"
audiobooks,"Hey, I have a lot of audiobook files I would like to play on my iphone, however the Apple protections pretty much only allow audible and itunes purchases and stuff like that to be transferred and played. I can put my files in dropbox and play them off my phone, but if an audiobook is split into multiple files I have to select each one because dropbox doesn’t have a playlist feature. Can I import these files to my phone? Is there an app or something where I can make a playlist of them? Or is this not possible on the iphone?"
audiobooks,"Hi all,

I've been told I have a relaxing voice, and I like reading audiobooks. Is there anything out there you'd like to be read to you (particularly old stuff that would be legal for anyone to read)? My goal here is to see what I can do as a performer and maybe even become internet friends with people who like audiobooks too. So what would you like to hear? I'm open to anything, including short stories, poems, etc. I've been thinking about Franz Kafka and the Secret History of the Mongols. But honestly I'm open to whatever interest lies out there :)

I'll set a link here so you can hear what my voice sounds like:

audiobooks,"So I've had an audible subscription for a long time, but have never really been able to get into any of them.  However, I just finished the audiobook for the Disaster Artist, written and read by Greg Sestero, and I really enjoyed it.  I think a big part of that was Greg reading it in a more casual, conversational tone than a lot of the other, more ""theatrical"" types of productions that I had tried in the past. What are some other good audiobooks, of any genre, that have a similar kind of theatrical tone?"

All my local audiobooks were wiped. The app is also unusable for me. 

My dropbox account is still connected and I can download content. Content won't show up until I trigger a resort (i.e. sort on title or author). Then if the app is closed all content is lost.

It's moments like these where the hate side of the love / hate relationship I have with iOS kicks in and I wish I could downgrade apps or even iOS. 

Anyone else having this experience? It's had a surprisingly big impact losing access to my content. Open to alternatives. I submitted a message to the developer Tim Bueno as well."

I’m okay to try anything, but lean towards fantasy with some kind of love story or a murder mystery. Any suggestions?"
audiobooks,"Narrated by the hyper-talented Mark Boyett, my Ixan Legacy series tells the story of humanity's struggle for survival against an all-powerful alien foe...

...and I've unearthed a limited number of Audible download codes to share for the series!

**It's first-come, first-served.**

Here's what to do:

1 [Check out the series page](https://www.audible.com/series/Ixan-Legacy-Audiobooks/B079RBMWHL) and see if it piques your interest

2 Comment below and **tell me if you need a code for US or UK**

Do that, and I'll message out codes until they run out.

(Audible doesn't offer codes outside of US and UK sadly.)

Note - so that I stay in compliance with Audible's Conditions of Use:  the idea with these codes is that you'll leave a review after listening. I'm the author of this series, and your review goes a long way.

Thank you for your support. :)

**UPDATE:** I'm out of US codes but working on trying to get some new ones. If you're in the US and interested in the series, you can still comment  to reserve one of the new codes - provided I'm able to get them. If you're in the UK: I still have plenty of codes for you, so comment away!

**UPDATE 2:** I got a new batch of US codes and then ran out again! Thank you so much for your interest in my work, it truly means a lot. I'm going to work on hopefully getting more US codes for anyone else interested in the series, so leave comment if you'd like one. :) (I still have UK codes.)"

I also have to drive back after a week, so either one book around 16 hours or two books around 8 hours each would work."
audiobooks,"Hey everyone.
I’m not looking to bring toxicity into your community rather I’m trying to understand different points of views. Right off the bat I want to say, I’m not a fan of audiobooks due to a key observation I’ve made over the years:

Audiobooks reward completion over understanding. 

Too many times have I seen people pick up audiobooks and say they put them on 1.5x or even 2x speed just to:
A. Get through the book quickly
B. Meet their goal of one book a week
C. Claim some form of understanding

I find it mind boggling. Taking in a book, for me at least, is a commitment. It’s an activity for which I have to set aside a large interval of time to focus solely on reading. I find that audiobooks like music open the door to multitasking and at the end of the day, they simply become background noise. It’s like trying to focus on each little detail of the bass, drums, guitar, and vocals while doing a hand stand. Has it come to the point were people really can’t sit down and devote their attention to a single task? Audiobooks seem like a hassle in terms of letting me go back to check if I truly understood something so in the end they seem conducive to a single listen just for people to tick that checkbox and move on.

However, I know I can’t use my observations as a generalization. I’m not an auditive person, visual more than anything, so it might further prove how disconnected I am. So for that reason, I signed up for a free trial on audible, and I wanted to ask which recommendations you guys could give me for my first audiobook.

What value do you guys find in audiobooks? How do you listen to them? Has it dramatically changed your way of taking in information? How about the understanding vs. completion problem I mentioned? Is that part of my argument valid?

I would love to hear from you guys!"

audiobooks,"Those of you who enjoy non-fiction and are looking for the best bang for your buck might want to check out a subscription to The Great Courses Plus.

We have previously discussed the Great Courses lecture series by The Teaching Company (along with the lesser known but also excellent The Modern Scholar Series.

Over the last few years TTC has been making new lectures in both Audio and Audio/Video format. The av stuff is being marketed under The Great Courses Plus brand. Most of the lectures are 30-45 mins in courses of 12-36 lectures. Most are available either as audio only or as AV. The audio only is of course easier and quicker to dl and takes up less storage but in some cases the visual component is useful in enhancing understanding if you are able to watch as well as listen.

Their current deal is a free 14 day trial (one month with the promo code FREEMO then either monthly ($19.99 A month or quarterly $30 a quarter.) obviously the quarterly option is much better value.

This allows unlimited listening to their 100s of lecture series. Traditional they have been good at academic topics such as history, science etc but in recent years they have expanded to include more practical less academic topics too. You can download the app to phone, tablet TV, various smart phone devices. There is a download option as well as streaming but I suspect the data is stored in an app specific format rather than an easily copied mp4 file. With unli monthly access to a substantial library for less than a single audiobook on Audible, it looks worth checking out for non fiction lovers."

My SD card failed so I lost all my audiobooks and their positions/bookmarks. I currently use Smart Audiobook Player but to my disappointment using another card with the audiobooks reuploaded does not 'restore' the positions or bookmarks.

Sadly the wiki does not give an overview of the abilities of the recommended apps.

Keep in mind that I am not interested in hosting/uploading my audiobooks themselves. It's only about positions and bookmarks."

That was more than I remembered it being a few years ago so I checked audible's website and they show the monthly price to be $14.99 +taxes.

I'm struggling to understand why there would be such a difference in price depending on how you sign up. The $24.99/month only gets you 1 credit a month, and the app doesn't let you make cash purchases for any additional audiobooks, instead you have to buy another credit for $24.99.

What are your favorite books that are interesting from the start?

I love cyberpunk, virtual reality, sci-fi, horror and i find myself avoiding fantasy (feels bland, but i'd like to find a good one), but i'll give anything a try (albeit a short one). And i LOVE dramatized audiobooks."
audiobooks,"I am trying to decide the best file format/structure to store audiobooks. I like having a single .m4b file for an audiobook, but it is a lot of work to convert audiobooks divided into multiple .mp3 files into a single .m4b file. Also, it is a lot of work taking a single .mp3 and using audacity to find silences to create chapters for an .m4b file.

audiobooks,"In the preface to *Future Home of the Living God*, Louise Erdrich recommends that you listen to an author narrate their own work whenever possible. I really love listening to her books, and her narration brings a lot to the table. Another standout is Donna Tartt reading *The Secret History*. I can't imagine anyone else voicing the characters with as much care and consistency.

What audiobooks have you enjoyed that were ready by their authors?

As the author of ***CHANDOS AVENUE,*** I am proud to announce that the audiobook version is available to download for free with US &amp; UK codes.

Andrew Hixson (Author), David Bufton (Narrator), The John Handful Mysteries (Publisher)

**Message me for details.**

***Chandos Avenue*** is a five-bedroomed house in one of the most sought after areas of Beodericsworth. Owned by Jason Barker, John Handful is slightly reluctant to answer a letter demanding his services by the Chairman of Beodericsworth Ornithological Society. Entering the strange world of bird-watching Handful is a little at a loss at his ability to help. He is apparently meant to consult on someone embezzling the society's funds and Jason Barker's reoccurring dream, of death, something not usually within his remit. The dream haunts Jason and only 24 hours after dismissing the bemused detective the dream becomes real. What ensues is a perplexing short story in which everyone is thrown into disarray and the mystery of secret lovers, flowers, and a death that is not as it appears, slowly unfolds."

*The Wrath of Lords*

 **When heroes fail, send a monster.**  


When a dispute with a band of bloodthirsty mercenaries turns deadly, the townspeople want Warden Esben Berengar held accountable. The local lord offers to overlook Berengar's crimes in exchange for help finding his niece, abducted by a monster.  


But nothing's ever that easy, and Berengar soon finds himself cursed by a witch. He has three days to lift the curse and face the monsters--human and otherwise--that stand in his way to save the girl.  


Berengar's no hero, but he'll have to do. Darker times are coming, and the land of Fál needs a warden more than ever.  


Step into a dangerous new world of fantasy and magic, where the greatest monsters are the ones that lurk inside us. 

&amp;#x200B;

*The Blood of Kings*

Being a warden is tough work at the best of times. Keeping the tenuous peace between the five kingdoms of Fál is a difficult business, especially in a land of monsters and magic.  


Esben Berengar, the realm’s most feared warden, relies on his wits and his axe to deal with unscrupulous rulers, bloodthirsty outlaws, and the occasional witch.  


When the king of Munster is murdered, Berengar is called upon to investigate. Many had cause to want the king dead, and treachery lurks behind every corner.  


As tensions between humans and all others threaten to boil over, the warden finds himself reluctantly partnered with Morwen, Munster’s court magician, to solve the murder before the killer strikes at the royal family again. 

&amp;#x200B;

*The City of Thieves*

The hunt for a mysterious enemy leads Berengar to Dún Aulin, where an old friend’s request thrusts him headfirst into danger. It’s up to Berengar to prevent the sword used by the Lord of Shadows in his conquest of Fál from falling into the wrong hands.

To do that, he’ll have to survive vengeful goblins, bloodthirsty monster hunters, Leinster’s powerful Thieves Guild, and worse.

Much worse."

My partner has been suffering from a concussion-related brain injury since the beginning of this year.  She's barely able to read, engage in prolonged conversations, or concentrate on anything that requires her mind to be active.

We used to joke that I should actually make a career as an audiobook narrator, so I thought it might be fun to read her favorite book, *The Moon and Sixpence*, and surprise her with something to listen to.  

The ""deliverable"" would be a small file of some sort that she could listen to from her phone.

As far as equipment goes... Right now I have a Samsung Galaxy phone, MacBook Pro, and these [earphones](https://global.1more.com/product/triple-driver-in-ear-earphones/) with a microphone.

100 copies of three stories. Quick summary of each:

# [**WILDERNESS (thriller / crime / mystery):**](https://kingsumo.com/g/rk6rvk/100-audiobooks-by-lancelot-schaubert)

When a seventeen-year-old track star turns up mangled and dead on the switchback road by the Crescent Hotel, his poker crew grows suspicious of one another. Ebur, a retired cowboy, finds himself in the middle of a once-trustworthy group who all knew and loved Brady.

Or did they?

And can he trust them if they think he killed the boy?

Covering the broad swatch of lifestyles and struggles in off-peak Eureka Springs, Wilderness asks hard questions about retired men and those who try to tame them.

# [**WOMBROVERS** (fantasy / sci-fi)](https://kingsumo.com/g/rk6rvk/100-audiobooks-by-lancelot-schaubert)

At ten feet, four inches tall, Gowanus was the runt of the litter. Working the mines of No’ad took strength and height, unless you had the smarts to be able to help the dwarves invent and build new mining tools. He didn’t have smarts and didn’t have height, and yet his curiosity got the better of him: where had Sakima gone?

In an attempt to find the rogue giant Sakima, Gowanus learns the secret to how the giants have spread so far, so fast and comes face-to-face with the worst betrayal of giant-kind.

# [**CARRY CANNONS BY OUR SIDE** (pirate fantasy)](https://kingsumo.com/g/rk6rvk/100-audiobooks-by-lancelot-schaubert)

A young pirate-in-training shadows his dad as his father chases down the man who stole his cargo. Confronted with cannons, the young pirate fears their tiny fifteen-man crew will die quickly, but his father shows him a magic more powerful than all the cannon fire in the world. The only problem? It's not iron and cotton the other pirate stole.

It's precious human life.

audiobooks,"I have just finished listening to the Dresden files and I need more of a similar blend of dry humour action and feel of the story, so if any of you fellow resistors have any ideas please share. Ugh sorry for the typo."
audiobooks,"I generally enjoy stories where sex is not a concern. I don't really mind romance but beyond quick kisses and cuddling I start to feel like a creepy voyeur. Mind you I don't want a kid's story either. I like strong female characters that are not defined by a man, nerdy male characters that are oblivious to love, children who have adult personalities but still don't have those urges because they are too young, and non-human characters that just ignore that aspect.

I prefer Sci-Fi and Fantasy, but dislike depressing settings like dystopias/ post apocalyptic. I like humor but not when it becomes the utter nonsense satire of Douglas Adams, Terry Pratchett, or Christopher Moore. I enjoy meta narratives that do homages of other works, drop references, or do callbacks to previous jokes."

audiobooks,"I’m proud to be the narrator of Infinitum One: Origin, a fun new take on the superhero genre. 

Publisher’s Description: 

Not all heroes are heroes because they want to be...sometimes, they’re heroes because they’re chosen to be.

——

Ed Helquist never asked for superhuman strength, or extraordinary speed, or the voice in his blood that tells him when and where trouble will occur; those things just arose in him one day, calling him into danger and forcing him to help people without knowing why. His best friend Casey has a ridiculous theory: somehow Ed is becoming a superhero, an idea that Ed just can’t allow himself to believe. When Lane Daniels appears and reminds Ed of an extraordinary incident from their childhood that supports the possibility, Ed has no choice but to allow that his powers have been with him for longer than he’s realized - and now, they seem to be evolving. His simple life is becoming more and more complicated every minute, and a mysterious woman who keeps showing up to cause trouble may hold the answers to everything...if only she she’d stop trying to kill him long enough for him to ask.

After looking into the creation of audiobooks vs story time it seems to me it is okay to read a book on youtube..however i still haven't been able to determine if it's alright to record me reading the book and then sell it on my website.

I am not wanting a ""professional"" audiobook recording..what I am doing is reading the book *with* commentary. A shorter version would be public on youtube, and a longer version would then be up for purchase on a separate website. Again, I would not be reading these books straight through, but pausing for commentary.  Also they are videos, not just audio..audio would be available, but I will still have visuals of myself, others, and possibly other images pertaining to the text/topic.

If anyone is able to send me copy write info or anything regarding fair use that would be awesome. I'm still doing research, but I'd really like to get feedback on this...also feedback on if this sounds interesting to anyone! I'd love to hear what you'd all think of this idea before I do it...cause I WILL figure out a way to do this...core fans start now ;) hahaha"

For example, a book that just came out recently is A Light in Hidden Places which is a true story about a Polish woman hiding Jews and housing Nazis in the same house. However, the author actually contacted that woman's nephew who is still alive to get all the details. The story is written from her perspective and has dialogue.

booksuggestions,"A book about anything, BUT the main characters are friends and very well developed characters that end up together. Not a story where one is secretly crushing on the other, with a very basic storyline either miscommunication or some evil person keeping them apart. Lately I only find books like that and it's so. Pre.dic.table. 😴

I love reading about how relationships develop and how people go through ups and downs and come out stronger. 

I am not a fan of Rainbow Rowell but I did enjoy her characters in Fangirl very, very much. And the slowness of the story was sweet.
Also I recall coming across a book about a woman whose husband is diagnosed w cancer and how they work through it... Never got a chance to read it sadly."

While I would prefer something serious and with some intrigue I'll take some humorous suggestions as well. Thanks in advance!
booksuggestions,I’ve always had a fascination with Florence and the Renaissance. I just finished reading the Birth of Venus by Sarah Dunant and wanted to know if any of you had any recommendations? Thanks!
booksuggestions,"The title really says it all, I'm just looking to get a better idea on what Europe was like in between the period of the Roman empire and the modern day development of nation-states around the 19th century. I want a book that talks about Western Europe and how each of its people broke away from Roman control and identity. 

Also, please nothing that shills hard for a ""return to tradition."" Nothing that's too euro-centric either - I know that sounds like an oxymoron, I just don't want an author who thinks ""western culture"" is the greatest thing since sliced bread"

booksuggestions,"Don't know why but latley I've been in the superpowered and romance mood, and what better way to quench my thirst then to read about both!  doesn't really matter what the story is about but I would definitely prefer if the main character was still in high school. Oh to be young and in love while having telekinetic superpowers..... Bonus points if he doesn't hide it from her for like half the book!"
booksuggestions,"I  finished A Little Life in about 3 days and although it wrecked me, I fucking loved it. I haven't felt this connected to a book since I read Dune as a pre teen. I would appreciate more recent recommendations as I've gone through many of the previous lists discussing this book from arounf 2015-17.

  I am a person who has been continuously cutting themselves for years and have never related with a character more than I have with Jude. The way Hanya describes why he does what he does resonated with me HARD. 

I would love a recommendation that would devastate  me in the same way this book did. It doesn't have to be about self harm, or depression or cutting, but I want to FEEL it.  I have already read The Heart's Invisible Furies, The People in the Trees and  All the Ugly and Wonderful Things.

Thanks everyone!"
booksuggestions,"The title is pretty much what I'm looking for. I've been reading a lot of different threads trying to come up with a list but it's such a NICHE! I'm about to list off a *bunch* of stuff I look for in books, but **if y'all have something in mind that only checks like 2 boxes I would still love to hear it!**

When I was younger I read CONSTANTLY, but I've found it really hard to get into a lot of books geared towards adults even though I've definitely outgrown YA. **The key (I believe) is the amount I can ""escape"" into the book.** A lot of adult fiction is full of the same mundane problems as the real world and the same suffering we deal with every day. While those stories are important, they're not what I want when I need to take a vacation from this reality.

On the flipside, a lot of Fantasy/Sci-Fi strays so far from the world we know that while the stories are often fantastic, it doesn't quite scratch the same itch in my brain as those oh-so-loved series from childhood. (Percy Jackson- set in the real world, but with GREEK GODS and POWERS and shit. Harry Potter- JK Rowling can piss *right* off ,,however,,,, set in the real world but with MAGIC). It's been really hard to find books that balance Fiction and Fantasy that are also geared towards adults, but a lot of Neil Gaiman's stuff fits the bill. Would love something a little like that if you've got it on your shelves. (Disclaimer, I've been recommended the Magicians series and while I WISH I liked it, I can't stand the narrator, so no need to comment about that one. It does have that exact sort of story, though.)

As an ace nonbinary person, I'd really love to see some **asexual, aromantic and/or nonbinary** characters that AREN'T robots/nonhuman and are accepted within their communities. Also! Would love to see some **well done wlw rep**! wlw relationships are so underrepresented in media, and so many are oversexualized or written for the male gaze. I've had a LOT of trouble finding wlw in adult fiction. :(

I'm also really into **morally-grey characters**, as well as anti-hero types (redemption arcs are welcomed!) but sadly haven't seen much **LGBT rep** in the books I've seen recommended under that umbrella. I think a lot of authors are hesitant to write antagonist-types that are also minorities b/c yikes (gay coding in villains, anyone?), so I definitely get it, but MAN do I want to see some good old 'be gay do crime' that's handled well and fun to read.

**I'd probably prefer:**

\-**NON-YA**: nothing wrong with YA novels, but (as I said) for the most part I've kind of read myself sick of them. Many tend to be geared towards a younger teen audience who are still figuring themselves out and while that is HUGELY important, I'm really looking for some characters who've got a bit more life experience under their belt. Also, it kind of gets under my skin when books explain my own identity to me-- I want to see people I relate to living their lives and having adventures of all types, not just sitting in high school classrooms or googling ""am I gay"" on Google at 2am. Been there, done that, want to see what's next, you know?

\-**Not too explicit**: I'm not *allergic* to sex scenes, but it would be really cool to see adult LGBT rep that's not *super* heavily focused on sex (hence the specific request for ace/aro rep). As an ace person, super explicit sex scenes in books/media often take me out of the narrative a bit, and interrupt the flow of the story. Note that I said ""super explicit"", as in like very descriptive, porno-esque dirty talk, etc. -- If it's implied or not too drawn out, I can just skip it, it's fine. Sex is an important part of a lot of adult relationships so I totally get that it's going to be a part of a lot of books as well, it's just not something I'm interested in so I'd prefer a little less of it in the books I read.

\-**Newer books**: especially when it comes to LGBT characters, a lot of older books tend to either be EXTREMELY subtle or straight-up problematic. not going to absolutely discount anything ""old"", but it seems as far as good representation goes I've found the newer stuff is allowed to be a lot more... honest? with its characters because the world is at least a little bit more accepting and the audiences are (hopefully) more educated.

\-**Character-focused**: I've come across quite a few books that have really awesome characters but so much worldbuilding and exposition and chunks of super plotty sections etc. that I finish feeling like I never really got to delve into what makes the characters great, or just lost interest. (I confess that it's a weakness of mine that I have trouble focusing on the plot if I can't get really attached to a character in some way-- which unfortunately keeps me from being able to fully enjoy some truly good books-- but it is what it is). 

Despite my wishes towards the contrary, I tend to go for stuff that feels a LITTLE bit rom-com. THAT SAID: totally willing to try out all sorts of books, because you never know!

Books like *The Secret History* and *Vicious* have the sort of moral greyness I'm talking about when it comes to the characters themselves, but like I said, I do have a soft spot for lighter narratives (unfortunately those usually don't have too many chaotic-neutral types, ha! too many wishes for one book). I've got *Documenting Light* by E.E. Ottoman on my to-read list, which seems to cover the character-focused LGBT rep aspects.

**Some other books I've read that capture the ""vibe"" of what I usually go for, just for reference:**

*Good Omens* by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett (love the snark, love the humor, LOVE the cleverness), 

*We Are Okay* by Nina LaCour (I KNOW I just said no YA, but what caught me about this book when I read it was the melancholy, the way the scenes were painted, the way it felt like you were really breathing with the characters)

along that same vein is *I'll Give You The Sun* by Jandy Nelson (again, would love something with this feel but older characters!! very much drawn to the artistic aspects as well as the narration, but I'm dead tired of reading YA. I'm an adult, I want to read about some adults please, or at least older teens???)

not a book, but a podcast I like (because of course I do) is The Magnus Archives. It's like paranormal-horror-anthology with really good LGBT rep, and if anyone knows of a book with a similar feel when it comes to characterizations I'm down to try it out!

A trope I will never tire of is the Found Family, so bonus points for that one. Usually pretty common in LGBT reads!

**This post is SO LONG so TLDR: Would LOVE to find some new books with positive ace/aro/nonbinary and other LGBT rep that have well-fleshed out characters. Romance welcomed, morally-grey shenanigans welcomed, wit and snark absolutely welcomed. Preferably a non-YA book. I generally read fiction, and love the type of fantasy where the world as we know it exists, but so does magic-- ESCAPISM is my JAM but gritty/dark storylines are cool as long as it's not gonna depress me for a week :)** 

Thanks in advance! I know a lot of this is a long shot but this community is really wonderful and you guys usually have some solid recommendations."

booksuggestions,"So about a year and a half ago, I read A Tale for the Time Being by Ruth Ozeki for the first time and it hasn’t left my mind. I’m still reading books, but nothing satisfies me as much as that book did. I’ve never had a “favorite book of all time” because all books and authors are special and unique in their own way, but this one might just claim that title. It’s left such a big impression on me and I’m so amazed by Ozeki and her writing, I literally cannot forget it. I’m currently re-reading it for the third time (haha yikes I know) but I don’t want to read it so much it’s value to me goes down or I lose interest because I’ve read it so much. Can anyone who’s read it recommend me more books that are similar? Or like tell me the genre/sub genre it’s categorized in? If you can that would be amazing!!"

I’m looking for something really digestible that you just can’t put down. I used to really love magical realism so anything like that would be great too! I also used to read YA and the last books I genuinely loved were by John Green and David Levithan. I also really like the Saga graphic series.

booksuggestions,"Untranslated Spanish Works

Hey folks, 

I’ve just started my first Fall semester as a graduate student in my uni’s MFA program. 

Part of my degree program involves taking a course in literary translation with a focus in translating from Spanish to English. 
As part of the course, we’ve been asked to select a Spanish text that hasn’t been readily translated. 

Any suggestions out there for works in Spanish that you know to be lacking an English translation? 

My focus is poetry, so poetry collections would be amazing but I would also appreciate some fiction. 

TL;DR 
Need suggestions for Spanish texts that haven’t been translated."
booksuggestions,"Hello. 

I'm looking for something to read, which I consider as not typical. 
Specifically, I'm looking for stories that revolves around a main protagonist who's like a golden needle in a rotten haystack. 

I'll cite 10 characteristics of what I seek. 

1. Mostly seen alone, he prefers to utter few words and doesn't waste his time on babbling nonsensical. 
He should be distant, emotionless and reticent, and people who see him--cheerful girls, for instance--consider him boring or weird. 
But, that's just how he is: stoic like a statue in a situation full of drama, unexpressive of his feelings, and may have no feelings. 

2. A kind and lovable human being to his family, yet, he's still retaining his silent demeanor. 
However, he's a devil incarnate to those who will endanger his life and his beloved ones. 
He may have another identity: one shrouded with darkness, death, evil, mystery, and riddles, who his family and people he acquiainted, are unknown and unaware of. 

3. Apathetic and unassuming, he may look like he doesn't care when injustice happens around his line of sight. But, actually, deep inside, is the urge to help out. However, his way of ""helping"" and/or ""saving"" will not be painless and smooth. 
Every self-entitled and spoiled brat heroes always shout, ""Stop this! You're insane!"" or ""This is for my friends!"" or, ""I won't forgive you!"" or, ""That's crazy! Why did you do something like that?!"" whatnot, and then, minutes of skirmishes later, they're lying on the ground like a tortured animal, winning eventually after some insufferable edgy plot armor. 
Unlike those characters, he's a cold-hearted monstrosity that even those he saved may fear him for eternity. 

4. Never ask for any compensation and reward from people who may benefit from what he's done. 
He just wants to do what he must, and leave when he's done. 
However, despotic people, prideful nobles and self-entitled elitist are what disgust the most of him. 

5. Not interested in every inch and nook of body parts of women and never desires to be in a relationship with an opposite sex. 
Not interested in selecting any subordinates to do his work and never intends to pick up slaves to satisfy himself. 
A man who prefers to do things by himself, all on his own. 

6. Stays away from unnecessary conflicts and may willingly do what a person demands. But, should his patience loose, he shall be merciless and unforgiving.

7. Tends to hide his power, skills and strength which he's overpowered, unparalleled, and unrivaled of. But, when situations asked, there's no holding back to do what's needed. 
Inhuman, comprable to a one-man army is maybe an understatement, because he's capable of turning a battle into a one-sided genocide with his own hands. God of Death would be more accurate.
Those who see it, fear him, because of him alone, of what he is, of what he can do. 

8. Even if he puts himself in a bad light, even if it makes people who know him turn to dislike him, and even if it leads to betrayal of his beloved ones to him, he'll never shy away of doing demonic and grotesque things such as killing people in front of their eyes, and not even an ounce of regret thereafter. 
A man who probably enjoys slaughtering those who deseve to kiss death. 

9. Diplomatic meetings, persuasive beggings and smooth talks are not the best thing to resolve a conflict, so, he never wastes his time with doing such. 
He should be capable of assassination, espionage and such that require stealth skills. 

10. One who doesn't get interested and never chase anything related to fame, luxury, status, titles, wealth and women. 
One who prefers to be in the shadows, in the darkness. 

Then, I'll jot down those I came across which I've opinions to relating the subject. 

1. King's Dark Tidings by Kel Kade 
Rezkin is not your typical fantasy hero troupe.
Growing up, he didn't have the peaceful lifestyle of every lowly commoner, nor the privilage of every proud nobility. 
Since birth, he endured treatment worse than slavery; mastered every manner of combat techniques way far than an average, or even an elite soldier; and learned every inch and nook and corners of public knowledge of the world. 
19 years later, the facility that honed him was destroyed, and then, he set out on an adventure, meeting various people and enemies at the same time. 
Whilst Rezkin has most of my criteria, there are so many disappointments as the story progresses. Most of it are the characters he accompanies. 80% of them are annoying and infuriating, and to make things worse, there is so much screen time with them than him. 
Then, there's the relationship that really contradicts his code. I prefer that he just travels alone and meets different people from time-to-time. 

2. Victor The Assassin by Tom Wood 
He's as the books' description depict him to be: cold-hearted, death incarnate. 
But, as strong as those synopsis describe him, as weak as I read of his journey across Russia, Europe, and America. 
Even if he puts on thousands of disguises and impersonation at the same time, his adversaries still manages to catch wind and get to him. And when he do the fighting, it'll only put a little scratch to them. 
When confronted by many, surrounded by numbers, he cannot do anything. He's only good long-range attacks and one-on-one.
Even after those life-and-death situations he barely managed to overcome, and his mysterious past, his skills stays the same, as his enemies are growing up. 
Agent 47 is miles better than him. 

3. Main Character Hides His Strength by Road Warrior 
Feared by all, Sungchul Kim is currently dubbed as Enemy of the World because of some complicated past. Unable to defeat the Demon Lord by Strength alone, he goes incognito to obtain what he needs to defeat him: Magic. 
Sungchul has everything what I'm looking. 

4. Forgotten Conqueror by Za1d3 
Kaidus is a powerful mage who obtained a second chance--reborn into the current era. 
In the past, as Rhultal, driven by vengeance, he was the enemy of the world whose rage had shaken it whole. 
Retaining his knowledge, memories, and power which is now incomprehensible to the present world, as he once again walking upon the lands of Lovis, he seeks out what happened to the world, to his former adversaries since his ""death,"" and the timeframe between it and his resurgence. 
Kaidus has also everything I'm searching, and tops this list. 

*Phew...*

As this list is compose of, it's not limited to just action and fantasy. It can also be an action with LitRPG, mystery, thriller, or action and not fantasy at all and set in a modern world.
A genre where the main protagonist has these 10 preferences, and can unleash them all.

Thanks, in advance."
booksuggestions,"Hi all, looking for some book suggestions as I’m starting to pick back up on reading.

I would like to read books, fiction or non-fiction, that tell the stories of how they went from being a loved child to ending up being someone seemingly all alone and who nobody seems to care about anymore."
booksuggestions,"So I just finished a fantasy series I really enjoyed (Licanius Trilogy) and I want to jump into a new book asap. However, I want a break from fantasy and just need a good, exciting page turner. I don't like horror so it needs to kind of ""toe the line"" without being terrifying/overly scary. I do like crime/murder mysteries but it doesn't have to be related to the genre at all.

Thanks!"

....apart from the Bible of course."
booksuggestions,"Anyone have any good suggestions for great (new) literary fiction set in nature (or with an interesting relationship to the natural world)?

booksuggestions,"Can anyone suggest a historical non-fiction that was hard to put down (non-historical non-fiction would be acceptable too)?

Some background to help: My aunt enjoys soft things a lot. She collects unicorns and loves tea and fairies and poetry and historical fiction type things. She also works with special needs children and is somewhat religious. A soft cottagecore type person. I want to send her a book either to distract her or help her get through what might happen in the next few weeks.

Just looking for some fantasy standalone or series recommendations. I’ve read and fully enjoyed books like ACOTAR, shatter me, the cruel prince, to kill a kingdom, a sorcery of thorns, six of crows, etc.

booksuggestions,"Hi all! For a number of reasons, I'm looking for some books that elicit an emotional response, particularly sadness and/or anger, but that part isn't absolutely necessary. Not only that, but I'd love to hear WHY these books make you feel that way - are they well written? Do you relate to the characters? What is it about the book that makes you feel one way or the other? 

My own list includes books like:

Revolutionary Road, Perks Of Being a Wallflower, The Tale of Despereaux , Frankenstein, The Burn Journals

For the most part, I either relate to, sympathize with, or identify as one of or multiple characters from these books"
booksuggestions,fantasy novel with main character who can resurrect himself or others.
booksuggestions,"Hey guys! I'm looking for something along the lines of Dan Simmons' *The Terror* (about the Franklin expedition) or Alma Katsu's *The Hunger* (about the Donner Party). It doesn't necessarily have to add supernatural elements to real world mistakes or tragedies. I'm just looking for something creepy or with a good sense of dread that isn't set in the present day. I'm also up for books not based on real events!

Thanks!"
booksuggestions,"I’m going through a divorce myself right now and want to read about similar feelings and experiences. I have yet to find books that realistically portray the emotions one goes through. Most are too preachy or falsely happy in the end. 

Some movies I’ve enjoyed to demonstrate style preferences: 
Blue Valentine 

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind

500 Days of Summer

High Fidelity (I’ve read it as well)

Eat Pray Love (was okay, I’m cool with finding yourself type stories)"

booksuggestions,I have just finished Midnight Rose and I loved the book so much! Such a rollercoaster of feelings!

booksuggestions,I really like NYC during the 50s
booksuggestions,"Really trying to get into reading again this year so I hope you can help me find something good. I enjoy books about a character who is figuring out their life. Mental health related books are good but might hit a little too close to home. I didn't really enjoy Eleanor Oliphant (recommended to me by reddit) the main character was boring to me. I enjoy the inner monologue of a character to first person narration usually best. Hunger Games is probably my favorite thing I've read because of Katniss and her inner voice and battling her own thoughts and insecurities and trying to achieve her goals in the middle of all of these obstacles. I do enjoy nonfiction reading as well. I recently really enjoyed watching the Legend of Korra so a similar strong, stubborn character would be fun too (I'm planning on reading Rise of Kyoshi novel once I can get ahold of it). I also come from r/TaylorSwift where my favorite songs of hers are about her journey with her music and how she battles her own demons constantly but comes out into the daylight to enjoy and appreciate the good things in her life. 


I just kind of rambled on about the things I enjoy, I hope this gives you a better idea of my taste and maybe the suggestions will be something more suited for me.


Here are the stories I've enjoyed recently:

__The Hunger Games Trilogy + Prequel__


__Year of Yes by Shonda Rhimes__


__Rebecca by Daphne Du Maurier__
 

__An Abundance of Katherines by John Green__


__The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath__


__Legend of Korra__"

She’s loving the vibe of all things british right now-looking for something with that quintessential british baking show/Paddington/ feel but for tweens. She’s NOT into romance at all and likes wholesome characters (not so into horror or violence). Sorry so specific-Would appreciate any thoughts!
booksuggestions,"The title, but I’d love to get suggestions outside of Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones as I’ve read and enjoyed both and looking for something different."
booksuggestions,"I have an English assignment which requires me to read a book a write piece from the perspective of a character other than the main character. This is what it exactly says 
[“Read a novel or play that challenges you, then choose a character or persona from this text whom is intriguing. Imagine you are that character or persona living before, during or after the events detailed in the text. Compose a complete piece of imaginative writing that expresses your chosen person’s thoughts and feelings and reflect on the events within the text. You also must write a mini blurb at the beginning of your piece outlining which part of the text you are reimagining (5-7 sentences maximum).”] 

My overall response is meant to be 700-800 words.

I’m in year 10 and I don’t read many books so I don’t want anything to sophisticated or difficult to understand. So could y’all please recommend me a book with and interesting character and state who the character is or even better if u could tell me from which part of the book I should talk about from their perspective. Thanks"
booksuggestions,"When I was a kid, my brother would always yell at me or silence me. He didn't like me at all. Like when we were at the dining table, he would yell at me just because of some few words. We lived in a city so I didn't really have friends to talk to and smartphones weren't a thing back then. I also get scolded a couple of times when I ask a question. When talking to relatives, I also get scolded at because they say I was being rude. I wasn't taught what I should say so going silent was my comfort zone. I also didn't have friends because of my fear of being silenced when I try to say something. Fast forward to adulthood, I need the skills. Is there a book that could somehow help me learn what I should have learned progressively for years?"
booksuggestions,I recently got back into reading but have only read these series first books and was wondering which one I should read?!?  I really don’t know what happens on either of these books (I’ve seen a few spoilers on TikTok for Harry Potter). So tell me which one I will get the most enjoyment out of.  Oh and for reference I’m a 17 year old girl who lives ya fantasy.

I read +/- 10 books a year, it's something I love doing and I know I'll keep at it until the day I die.

I have until september next year to read whatever you guys throw at me that you think would be beneficial for someone starting law school.

Thanks!"
booksuggestions,"I have also read Cell by Stephen King and enjoyed it. Something space horror may peak my interest too. Funny, I love to read horror books but can’t watch horror movies."
booksuggestions,"Hey its my first post soo i hope you guys forgive me for any error.
I am looking for books about werewolves, but treating them more seriously as either a treath or a an adventure.
I am thinking something like percy jackson but with main character being werewolf. I also enjoyed the movie girl in the red cape (yes ik its an adaptation of red riding hood) soo a thriller/ mistery is welcome.
Just tired of cheap romantic novels involving fall in love mates etc. I want some gut ripping, blood soaking wild dudes or even a good light adventure.
You guys are my last hope
Thanks"
booksuggestions,Looking for a good werewolf novel or series to listen to. Everything I have found on audible is romance stories and that's not my drift. Would like a story from the mindset of the wolfs but a hunter focus could work as well.
booksuggestions,"I am completely in love with The Magicians, the trilogy by Lev Grossman, and I'm looking for more books (or movies or whatever) like it.

More specifically, I like how the protagonist is aware of his almost endless potential (he's a frickin magician), he knows that he can achieve whatever he sets his heart on, but at the same time he can't find happiness or meaning in his life. 
I think it's meaningful that most of his ""adventures"" start basically because he's unsatisfied or bored or depressed, and not because ""some ancient evil is after him"" or "" he has to save the world"". Sure, after a while it almost always turns out that the stakes are much higher than he anticipated, and the fate of the world actually is in danger, but that's never the fact that sets things in motion.

Or, you know, also like Bojack Horseman, he's rich, he could do whatever he wants with his life, but he's stuck because he can't decide what's really important.

Any suggestions?
Thanks in advance :)"
booksuggestions,"So, I don’t read nearly as much as I should, I am more of a movie nerd. I absolutely LOVE a twist that is truly mindblowing (such movies as Witness to the Prosecutions, Vertigo, sixty sense, diabolique, memento, etc.)

I know Agatha Christie is a big option. I have read And Then There Was None, which was amazing.

So, I am only looking for books with truly amazing “holy shit!” twists, not “decent” twists or “quite good” twists, only amazing ones.

Suggestions?"
booksuggestions,"Hi people! 

Pretty simple: I'm looking for a novel where a third-person narrator is omniscient with respect to everybody except for the protagonist. 

I must not be the first person to imagine such a book! It seems like it could offer a great way to explore themes of alienation or empathy. Bonus points for something along those lines! 

One reason I'm interested in reading such a book is that it would seem to create some major challenges for the author, and it'd be fun to see them dealt with cleverly.

More broadly, if you know of any novels that make creative or novel use of a third-person limited narration that you think are relevant to my musings above, I'd love to hear about it!"
booksuggestions,"I finished Invisible Planets by Ken Liu (editor) and the Wandering Earth by Liu Cixin and I loved them both. They provided relief from the stale sci-fi books I had been reading. I am looking for other science fictions novels (fantasy elements are okay, but I am for specifically looking for sci-fi recommendations) either written by non-Caucasian authors or that contain non-Caucasian protagonists. Can anyone provide me with some recommendations?

Here are some examples of books that I read and enjoyed:

The Wandering Earth by Cixin Liu  
Invisible Planets by Ken Liu (editor)  
The Three-Body Problem (and the two sequels) by Cixin Liu  
Broken Stars by Ken Liu (editor)  
Blue Remembered Earth by Alastair Reynolds  
Ball Lightning by Cixin Liu

Here are some books I am thinking about reading:

Binti: The Complete Triology by Nnedi Okorafor  
Kindred by Octavia Butler  
Rosewater by Tade Thompson  
Dark Matter by Sheree Thomas (editor)

It's all good in terms of a specific non-Caucasian ethnicity. African, African-American, Indian, Middle Eastern, Native/Aboriginal, East Asian, Hispanic, and Central/South American all sound interesting."
booksuggestions,"I'm a big sucker for Star wars FF, I've been scouring FF.net, Spacebattles, and Webnovel for good ones but most are meh and the good ones get dropped, if you know of any good ones send them please, I might have read them but will probably read them again, btw if you haven't already check out  [Illuviar](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4764483/Illuviar)"
booksuggestions,"There is a lot to love about YA. It's often filled with fun characters, easy-to-read, and pretty grounded. Even when it tackles bigger topics it does so in a pretty discrete and character-centric way. However, sometimes I just need a break from reading about teens, high school, and puppy love. I'd really appreciate recommendations for adult-centric books that still have some of the fun and casual feeling of YA.

To be clear, I also love reading adult fiction and all that it has to offer in terms of complex characters and deep thematic explorations. But, that's just not what I'm looking for currently. I've got a lot going on in my work life and the world is generally a bit of a dark and scary place at the moment. Right now, I'm looking to be entertained rather than challenged.

Thank you!"

I'm a whiter than white dude from a country where we only see black people on TV. Since I moved to London of course that changed, but with everything going on recently, I want to know and understand more. 
So my question is, what are the books I should read to understand how black people live, struggle, feel in our modern days. I heard about one called ""Why I don't talk about racism with white people anymore"" or something like that, it was a big hit a year or two ago. Is that one any good? I'm especially looking for modern stuff, not historical novels or something."
booksuggestions,I'm looking for pirate stories similar to Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson. Any recommendations?

booksuggestions,Cause I just found out that it had 6 parts and I don't know if I'm ready for that commitment
booksuggestions,"I’d like the profanity / sexual language to be to a minimum. Fiction is fine as long as it doesn’t get to the level of aliens, leprechauns, etc. I haven’t read many books. I liked life of Pi and slumdog millionaire although those aren’t mystery books."

booksuggestions,"I was watching some 411 missing videos and came across a story of a Native American tracker who was brought in to find a boy missing for over a week.  The disappearance was baffling. No one had any plausible theory. The NA tracker gets to work and manages to pick up on a track and methodically follows it until he finds the missing boy. Alive. Just brilliant stuff. Then I searched online for similar things and came across a Dept of Homeland Security elite unit of NA trackers who help border patrol detect signs of human activity along the border. They are called ""Shadow Wolves"" (How fucking cool is that?) They often stop drugs and criminals. It's pretty interesting stuff. That got me thinking a NA tracker would be such a cool character in a mystery novel. A sort of western native american Jack Reacher lone hero mixed with the observational powers of a Sherlock Holmes.  Are there any non fiction books featuring a character of similar attributes.  If not, there should be. Lol"
booksuggestions,"I'm a big fan of stuff like Indiana Jones and Tomb Raider so i was wondering if could be pointed to some good books of similar content: exploring long-forgotten vaults/tombs, discovering mythical   treasures/relics etc with a potential fair dose of action and suspense as well."

I'm looking for a book I read awhile ago. I don't remember the title nor the author (sorry!), but I do remember some key points:

1) There's a gay cop

2) There's a gay medical examiner

3) They're both hiding their murders from each other.

4) The gay medical examiner's dad works as a cop.

5) They get into a romantic relationship over the serial killings.

Thank you so much in advance!"

I don’t really know what genre it fits into so any recommendations for books would be awesome. I also really enjoyed Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn, so I would be interested in reading more books like hers as well!

Bit specific. I'm looking for a book that makes me feel like Iron and Wine's song ['Flightless Bird, American Mouth' ](https://open.spotify.com/track/1X3T2J7S1s6aCIbmjFf2NG?si=HejgBRN5RxKfh0RgTrBexg).

A love story where the two main characters are really in love or fall in love but can never get together because of circumstances. A bit of nostalgia would also be good, but not for a certain time period in history but more of a personal nostalgia. 

I want my heart to break a little reading it.

Not really looking for strong action, fantasy, or sci-fi themes in this book but I read almost anything so am open. 

Thank you for suggestions 📖😊"

I’m looking for some fantasy book recommendations with living gods that are intertwined with the story. I read a series called the Tide Lords by Jennifer Fallon and I really liked how the gods were intertwined in the story, hidden as other characters etc. Super specific I know! Bonus points if there some parts are told from the POV of the gods. 


I’m halfway through the City of Stairs trilogy right now, it’s a great example of what I’m looking for.

College turned me more toward nonfiction because of my classes in American history. Law school made me hate reading, period. Cases and SCOTUS dissents are, generally, the stuff of nightmares and I wouldn't recommend them to anyone. It's been difficult to read for enjoyment since law school ended but I am trying. 

I need fiction recommendations. Please advise! Please recommend!

booksuggestions,Something like surreal botany but not as egregiously expensive and hard to find
booksuggestions,"I love the books of Walter Moers and Terry Pratchett bc of their clever humor and their self ironic approach. I also love that they play with stereotypes and language, as well as little bits of other popular fiction.
Their world building and their overall vibe are also one of the main reasons why I love them so much.

Do you know any authors that have the same kind of witty humor to them?
I would prefer authors that publish originally in German or French, but other languages are completely fine too.
Thank you &lt;3"
booksuggestions,"I just got into the series ""Edwardian Farm"" and I'm addicted. I'm looking for any books spanning the early 1800's to the early 1900's taking place anywhere in the world with a main focus on Europe.

The books can be about daily life, survival, history, dangers, technology....anything at all really. The time period is just really fascinating to me. 

I'd prefer non-fiction, but if there are any historically accurate fictional books I'll definitely read them."
booksuggestions,"Hi! I want a book that will keep me wanting for more with each page. Right now I am reading I am Pilgrim by Terry Hayes. 
Even though it is a good story, I feel it is full of cliches where the great American nation fights against the bad Arabic countries. Again, good storytelling but the topic is kind of losing me.
I want a smart topic like the one in Tomas Harris’ Hannibal Lector series. What I am trying to say is that I want another Silence of the Lambs or Red Dragon.

Internet has praised angels and demons a lot and I'm considering it but I'm afraid what if the cryptography and conspiracy theorist writing gets repetitive and boring if I keep on with Robert Langdon.
Secondly, when it comes to fiction, I enjoyed Percy Jackson, Maze Runner, and Divergent series as a kid. A friend has recommended me The Mortal Instruments series. Would it be of my interest when it comes to fiction? I'm currently 18 and I'm slightly less enjoying heroes of Olympus than as a kid, it seems kinda childish. Is The Mortal Instruments similar to that? Thank you!"

e.g Breaking Bad: Hank finding out and then the “tread lightly” scene is my fav of all time. 
The one I’m watching now is The Americans, and Phillip and Elizabeth have just told Paige who they are. 

Idk I just love this kind of thing and look forward to it when I know it’s bound to happen.

What are some novel equivalents? I realised I’ve never really had this from a book and I’m sure there must be so many great moments that I’ve been missing out on!!

booksuggestions,"To some extent, you get the picture from the title of this post. But let me provide some more background if you're interested. 

I joined my dad in our family business and we had a rough time together. Its scale simply didn't match my expectations and we had the usual father-son issues that you would expect. Eventually, I left the business, realizing my father had business ideas that were no longer viable and he was aggressively married to them. We remain close, I just had to leave to pursue a more fruitful career. In-parallel, his brother who he founded the business with, accused him of stealing money from him and I am reasonably certain that is not true. After a lot of bitterness, they split-up. But the split-up, my departure, the passing of my grandfather(his father), his relationship with my mom and life, has taken a toll on his confidence. He's now running a skeleton of the business he used to run and seems generally incapable of doing the simplest of things. I've given the details of the business because that was well and truly what kept him going everyday. He is better than that and I know it. He most certainly suffers from adult ADD as well and is also a little depressed now.  I'd like to suggest a book he can read so he can find a little bit of his lost mojo. What can I recommend ?
EDIT :ADD not ADHD"

All of these I have either read or are on my read list. Also, no books about Greek mythology or politics, like a song of ice and fire. I don't enjoy reading such books.

booksuggestions," J. B. West, chief usher of the White House, directed the operations and maintenance of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue—and coordinated its daily life—at the request of the president and his family. He directed state functions; planned parties, weddings and funerals, gardens and playgrounds, and extensive renovations; and, with a large staff, supervised every activity in the presidential home. For twenty-eight years, first as assistant to the chief usher, then as chief usher, he witnessed national crises and triumphs, and interacted daily with six consecutive presidents and first ladies, as well as their parents, children and grandchildren, and houseguests—including friends, relatives, and heads of state.
 
J. B. West, whom Jackie Kennedy called “one of the most extraordinary men I have ever met,” provides an absorbing, one-of-a-kind history of life among the first ladies. Alive with anecdotes ranging from Eleanor Roosevelt’s fascinating political strategies to Jackie Kennedy’s tragic loss and the personal struggles of Pat Nixon, Upstairs at the White House is a rich account of a slice of American history that usually remains behind closed doors."

I want something to read in the interim before the fourth book is released next year. Any suggestions are great, series are even better!"
booksuggestions,"I like books about odd characters or odd environments, preferably stand alone books. I know that’s kind of a broad ask, hoping I can help narrow it down a bit with the description. 

Discovered my love for it and the narration tone that often comes with it as a child with The Anybodies by N. E. Bode. Other books I have enjoyed as an older person are The House in the Cerulean Sea, The Trial by Franz Kafka, Samedi The Deafness.

I prefer no mysteries or horror but am willing to try. I strongly dislike romances with sexist tones (where the relationship is glorified) and really would steer away from romance as the primary plot. 

I do like fantasy, dragons, the occasional dystopia, and, of course, the mundane. 

Thanks in advance!"

Good Reads has quite a few suggestions, but I figured I would ask people to see what ones they like? I enjoy Harris’ notes at the end about the actual historical facts and context, but sometimes don’t care for the romance/sex - I can deal with it if the rest of the story is good though."

booksuggestions,"Hello! I really like fantasy books preferably not in our world. I'm specifically looking for the protagonist to have a love interest where they did not like each or hate other in the beginning. And throughout the book/series/etc, they develop a relationship. I don't like books that specifically focus on the relationship, its something more in the background. And the book to have a really good/interesting/serious plot as well. Generally the books I usually find that have this hate-&gt;love relationship are usually too focused on the relationship and I like characters to have other focuses other than just a relationship."
booksuggestions,"I want to learn about “adult responsibilities” such as knowing about credit cards, taxes, and mortgages so I can prepare myself in the future. Is there a book(s) that encompasses a wide range of these topics?"
booksuggestions,What is your favorite “so bad it’s good” book?
booksuggestions,"Recently found a trend in some of the books I've been reading that I enjoy. Alot of the SciFi &amp; Fantasy books feature a main character that starts at the bottom of the ranks (or importance/power if non-military SciFi) and end much higher up as the books detail the rise. A few series I've read that feature this below. If there are any that you think would fit please recommend. I've fallen behind on my goodreads yearly goal and it's time to catch up. 

1. Starship's Mage series by Glynn Stewart
2. Frontlines series by Marko Kloos
3. Man of War series by H. Paul Honsinger
4. Red Rising Saga by Pierce Brown
5. Ender's Saga by Orson Scott Card
6. The Night Angel Trilogy By Brent Weeks"
booksuggestions,"Long story short the girl I was dating and thought I was going to marry cheated and broke my heart. Looking for any kind of book that will make me feel good about myself. Anything where the main character over comes something and a happy ending.

I’m looking for something similar - strong female protagonists, medieval/magic, similar writing style (YA or MA). Thank you in advance!!!"

I'm open to any genre or book suggestion! but can you give a little bit about how far romance/sex goes? thanks!"
booksuggestions,"I'm talking about any relationship, boss-employee, teacher-student, siblings, parents-children, friends. One has these relationships with people and they act differently according to who they are dealing with, they follow their role. I want non-fiction books that analyse these relationships. How people behave in them, how they are formed and how to maintain them."
booksuggestions,"Long story short I'm young and love is something I long for in my live so I want to better understand it, if I could learn a couple or three of those (things/concepts/truths) you would have liked to know/understand before a certain point of your live where you would have gave that knowledge a good use, that would be increibly helpful for me.

Villain Vs Villain, Hero vs Villain, Hero vs Hero where they are in a type of duel.
Similar to Death Note, The Prestige or The Dark Knight. Where we have something like a rivalry going. Something where they are part of the other or just two sides of the same coin.

Also if it is a psychologicaly deep story it is a plus, but it is not necessary. It can be any genre as long as it is good."

Not a huge fan of the cliche self help books but I am open to anything at the moment.

Background: I am coming to terms with the fact that I am no longer 'in love' with my partner of 4 years, while I deeply care for him and still love him, I find myself just going through the motions and no longer really enjoying the life we have together and instead just fearing the change and guilt that will come with ending the relationship.

booksuggestions,"I need a read where I can understand how the conspiracies worked in any setup. For example between kings merchants and traders as my game involves with these. I also need some general idea as how a merchant could up his popularity and money through dishonest means without being a criminal(without commenting crimes like killing, plotting for total removal of an opponent merchant). I mean something where the merchants primary intention is to mainly secure his way up, dethrone the competitors above his league, make it difficult for competing merchants to defeat him. Basically in my game the players are merchants and this is going to be a campaign+multiplayer mixed. I intend to have characters like priests, kings, mafias, colonizers, bandits ministers etc. And organizations like merchants guilds alliances, kingdoms, colonies etc. I hope you get the picture as to what I am seeking.

Hi! I am looking to diversify my reading palette + add some ideas to my Dungeons and Dragons campaign. I really liked The Poppy War by  R. F. Kuang if that helps! Does anyone have any suggestions for something similar to Kuang's book, perhaps with more imagery? I also enjoyed the imagery from God of Small Things by Arundhati Roy. Bonus points for little/no romance as I am not a fan of that. 

TLDR; Looking for medieval/historical fantasy/action books written by POC and/or women! Little to no romance as well as beautiful, flowery imagery for bonus points!   


Thanks in advance, looking forward towards reading your suggestions."
booksuggestions,"Hi folks,

I'm a big fan of existentialism and love casually studying the field. I normally juggle 1 fiction book and 1 non-fiction at the same time. I've recently finished my last fiction (Left Hand of Darkness [amazing book]) and close to finishing my non-fiction (The Myth of the State); I'm planning on moving onto the 2nd half of Being and Time and want the next fiction  book to compliment it a bit.

So, does anyone know of any good books that have existentialist themes? I've already read:

&gt; Dostoyevsky's The Double (3/5) and Notes From the Underground (4/5)

&gt; Kafke's Metamorphosis (4/5), The Trial (3.5/5 slow at times but that sorta added to the experience) and The Castle (1/5 I found it very boring)

&gt; Sartre's Nausea (2/5 I get Sartre himself says nothing outside of the themes he's trying to convey are substantial in it but my god it's dull)

I can handle slow burners but Nausea and the Castle took the piss for me personally. Any help would be ace, thanks pals."

Family is very important to him.

He is not an active person, but I feel he really seeks human connection, and the simple beauties in life.

I'm looking for some books I could gift him to his birthday. Something with a meaningful content that could give him hope (he isn't religious), a beautiful story thst suits a middle aged, suburban man, who lived his life mostly in the same city, doing the same routine, and doesn't seem to mind it too much, yet I feel he is looking for something deep and meaningful.

Thank you very much in advance.

booksuggestions,"**Definitions**

* Humans = Everyone from the genu ”homo”
* Sapiens = Homo sapiens (Our species)
* Species = Similar living organisms that can reproduce with each other.
   * Every two species that have a common ancestor were at one point two populations of the same species.

### The book in a nutshell:

Why are humans so powerful?

**Cognitive revolution:**

* We could communicate more information about the surrounding world
   * This allowed better planning and complex actions
* We could gossip
   * Up to 150 people could cooperate
* We invented fiction (Religion etc.)
   * Cooperation between EVEN more than 150 people!
   * Rapid behavior change! (Independent of our genes)

**Agricultural revolution:**

* We started producing our food for ourselves, so we had more food per area and then we multiplied
* We also started writing and using money

**Scientific revolution:**

* We admitted ignorance and started using the scientific method.
* Capitalism created growth
* We started believing in progress!

### Overall timeline

* 13.5 billion years ago: Big bang
* 4.5 billion years ago: Planet earth
* 3.8 billion years ago: First organisms
* 5-7 million years ago: First human ancestor evolved from the apes
* 2 million years ago: Humans traveled through continents and evolved into different species
   * Homo sapiens evolved from the ones (Homo erectus among others) that had traveled to East Africa
* 300.000 years ago: We started using fire daily
* 150.000 years ago: Homo sapiens date back to this date at least
* 70.000 years ago: ***Cognitive revolution***
* 12.000 years ago: ***Agricultural revolution***
* 10.000 years ago: Now homo sapiens are the only type of humans left.
* 500 years ago: ***Scientific revolution***

### How the past shaped us

* The agricultural revolution and everything from there on is the blink of an eye, compared to our years of hunting and gathering. So our bodies aren’t optimized for our modern environment
   * That’s why we binge on sweets and greasy food.
* Foragers needed more skills and knowledge about the natural world than we do today
   * Today we only need specialized knowledge about our work, while relying on others for everything else
* We rose quickly to the top of the food chain compared to other species.
   * This is the reason that we are still filled with fears and anxieties because we used to be in the middle of the food chain.

# Cognitive revolution

* Accomplishments from 70,000 to 30.000 years ago:
   * Boats
   * Clothing
   * We traveled to Australia
   * We made the first known art.
* Living conditions:
   * Most sapiens lived on the road
   * They ate a more varied diet and were less likely to suffer from malnutrition.
* It’s believed they were animists
   * So they believed that all objects have feelings, desires, awareness and could be communicated with.
* Humans jumped to the top of the food chain:
   * We have walked on two legs, used tools, had complex thinking and complex social structures for millions for years
      * Still… It’s only in the last 100.000 years that we jumped to the top of the food chain
   * The proposed reasons we jumped to the top of the food chain:
      * We could communicate more information about the surrounding world
      * We could gossip
      * We invented fiction

# The agricultural revolution

* We started producing food for ourselves
* This required settling down to one place
   * We significantly altered the places to suit our needs.
   * We treated animals in cruel ways
   * Luxuries (food) become necessities and often produce new responsibilities
   * We started worrying about the future because we somewhat had control over it and it affected the production of food.
   * People worked more but got a worse, less varied diet.
* Since more food was available per area, humans multiplied exponentially.
   * Thereby, increasing our evolutionary success, because we get more copies of our DNA.
* Money
   * The first kind of money (barley) was used 5000 years ago
   * Money is the most efficient and most universal system of mutual trust

# The scientific revolution

* It’s only in the last 500 years, that there has been a connection between science, technology, and war.
* Before the scientific revolution, most people didn’t believe in progress
* We started working according to clocks in the industrial revolution, because we only produced parts of products, and thereby were dependent on other people showing up.
* Families and local communities used to be the norm but were now replaced with the state and the market.
   * You used to be as good as dead if you left your family and local community
* We became individuals:
   * Choosing who we marry (Instead of our parents influencing us)
   * Choosing our job (Instead of working in the family business)
   * Choosing where to live (Even if we can’t visit our family weekly)

### Why did the Europeans rule the world when we weren’t more advanced technologically?

1. Modern science.

* Three Characteristics:

1. Admitting we don’t know (ANKI)
2. Focus on observations and mathematical models
3. Possibility of new technology

* When the British conquered other countries they brought scientists with them
   * When they conquered India they examined ruins that Indians had ignored and discovered the first Indian civilizations.
* Science is often financed with political, economical or religious agendas

1. Capitalism

* Economic history = Growth
* We achieved growth by creating credit (Loaning from the future)
   * The reason we haven’t done this before is that, before the scientific revolution, people didn’t believe in progress.
   * Capitalism works when profits are reinvested in production
* Should markets be completely free?
* Slaves were sold to make sugar for Europeans because it made sense from the perspective of supply &amp; demand.
   * Ethical considerations should also be made
   * Profits should be gained in a fair way

### Advancements in the scientific revolution

* Good things about our advancements:
   * In the nineteenth century, hospitals were still cutting off soldiers’ arms and legs (without anesthetics), because we didn’t know about antibiotics and sterilization methods.
   * All production used to come from the muscles of humans and animals.
      * Then came the steam engine, electricity, etc.
      * In the seventeenth hundred England, 1/3 of children die before age 15, while today it’s only 7 out of 1000.
   * Things have gotten more peaceful
      * In 2000 only 1.5% died because of war and violent crimes.
      * Reasons that we have less war:
* Bad things about our advancements:
   * Bad for all animals
   * Bad for the living environment we can live in.
* Today supply has outpaced demand
   * So what should buy all this stuff?
      * Consumerism is born

# Other topics from the book:

### Happiness

* It’s not an evolutionary advantage to be happy all the time. Happiness needs to fade, so we are motivated to pursue new things.
* We tend to stabilize at some happiness level, which is different for everyone.
* What makes us happy?
   * Money helps up to a certain point
   * Family and community is important
   * Illness doesn’t affect long-term satisfaction
      * Unless:
* Happiness depends on our expectations
   * This is why mass media and advertising can destroy our happiness
* Different perspectives
   * We only experience happiness because of chemicals in our body
   * We experience happiness if our life seems meaningful and worthwhile.
   * According to Buddhism our happiness neither depends on external events nor internal feelings

### Meaning of life

* From a scientific view, no meaning seems to exist for humans
   * The planet could go on existing without us.

### Humans are moving towards unity / Globalization

* From a birds-eyes-view, humans have moved towards bigger and more complex civilizations
   * 12.000 years ago we had thousands of disconnected human worlds that didn’t know about each other
   * 500 years ago we had just 5 disconnected worlds, where one of them contained 90%
   * Now all previously disconnected human worlds are influenced by each other. No original/authentic culture exists
* Factors that facilitated the movement towards unity
   * Money
      * Reciprocity didn’t work with strangers, who would never return the favor.
      * Trading was inconvenient
      * The soviet union tried gathering and distributing according to everyone’s needs
   * Empires
      * We are all shaped a lot by the roman empire, Arab caliphate, and the European empires
      * In the 19th century the British empire covered more than half of the globe, and spread European ideas and norms, like:

### Religion:

* Most religions started as animism
   * Believing all object have awareness and desires
* Then things turned towards polytheism
   * Because if there only was a single god, he wouldn’t have desires and biases
   * But often they still had some kind of universal creator
* The first monotheist religions started around 350 BC.
   * Before this, there were also beliefs about an all-encompassing faith/atman, but now god also had biases and desires.
   * Monotheistic religions were more missionary
   * Doesn’t make sense why evil exists, if an all-encompassing loving God created everything.
* Dualist religions
   * Believe in the battle between good &amp; evil.
   * Are better at explaining why evil exists
   * Doesn’t explain the common laws between the fight of the good and the evil.
* Other religions like Buddhism, Daoism, Confucianism, cynicism, and stoicism believed in natural laws, rather than divine will.
   * According to these religions: If gods exist, they are also governed by the same laws.
   * Buddhism believes the cause of suffering is craving, which is a product of the mind. Wanting bad things to go away and wanting more of the good things.
* The book also sees communism, liberalism, nationalism, Nazism, etc. as religions
   * 3 types of humanists

1. Liberal humanists: Every individual is sacred and should have freedom
2. Socialist humanists: The collective is sacred, so we should have inequality
3. Evolutionary/Nazi humanists: We should help those races with good genes while getting rid of the rest.

### How homo sapiens are different

* Most other species have close relatives
* Multiple species of humans existed before us, and many at the same time, but the last one died 10.000 years ago.
   * Our closest ancestor now is the chimpanzees
   * Two theories of why the other human species went extinct
   * The interbreeding theory: We mated and mixed with the other species
      * There is some proof of this. Europeans DNA is 1-4% the same as Neanderthal DNA.
      * The replacement theory: We killed all other species
      * Most likely it is a mix of both
   * Humans are born prematurely compared to other species
      * Therefore, there is more time to educate and socialize the children
      * Tribes are needed for help because women can’t take care of these prematurely born children.
* The most unique thing about our language is that we can talk about things that don’t exist
   * Examples of things that only exists in our collective imagination:
      * Religion, gods, nations, laws, justice, human rights, money, companies.
   * Three things that maintain these fictions

1. They are manifested in the physical world
2. They shape our desires

* “Follow your heart” was implanted in our minds with romantic myths in the nineteenth century
* Romantic ideas of having as big a variety of experiences as possible
* Holidays
   * Egyptians build pyramids, but would never travel
   * Consumerism

1. They exist across almost all peoples minds

* Why is fiction so powerful?:
   * Biology sets the foundation, while fiction allows us to play more complex games.
      * We can change behavior based on fiction (nations, laws), while most animals can only change based on genetic alterations and environmental changes.
   * But they allow extremely flexible cooperation
      * Individuals in other species can only cooperate with a few trusted others or their relatives.
      * When looking at individuals one by one, we are not that different from chimpanzees, but the way we can cooperate and build on top of each other is what makes us powerful.
      * No other species engage in trade
* We write
* We first began writing about 5000 years ago
   * The first writing was for record-keeping (taxes)
   * Writing changed our thinking
* Homo sapiens destroy/change the environment more than any other animal.
* No other species cares about the rest of the species
* We probably only care because of the recent globalization/movement towards unity
* All other animals have a “us and them” mentality
* The things that are considered masculine and feminine varies across time and cultures.

### The end of sapiens

* We can change the course of nature with intelligent design (Biological engineering)
* Since we are motivated by saving lives, and science helps us in this pursuit, we are likely to move towards of world of superhumans

That was it...

You could also have read this summary on my [blog](https://learnfromnotes.com/index.php/2020/07/24/sapiens-a-brief-history-of-humankind-yuval-noah-harari-book-review/). (In the future I will have more blog posts)

Please tell me what you think about this bullet-list type of summary :)"
booksuggestions,"Does anyone know of a good book that shows what a society with magic, elves ,dwarves, and other fantasy staples would look like when technology has advanced further than what even exists in modern day? Preferably not a ""magic has gone out of practice and is only thought of as stories"" kind of thing"
booksuggestions,"I've found with a lot of the novels I've been reading, particularly classics and modern classics, I have been really interested in the philosophical themes they explore.  After reading, I find myself trying to do more research on various philosophical thought from  Socrates and Plato to Descarte to Satre and Wittgenstein. 

Found some great resources online but figured it was time to expand my knowledge on philosophy as a whole.  Particularly like the School of Life YouTube series on literature and philosophy.  

Anyone have any recommendations for non-fiction books that sum up and examine a lot great philosophers, old and new?  I found a book called A History of Western Philosophy by Bertrand Russell that might hit the mark, but wanted to see if y'all had any suggestions :)"
booksuggestions,Know any books written by Geminis? I think Geminis are so interesting and I’d like to read more work by them
booksuggestions,"There seem to be quite a number of books about how big data and new technologies can exacerbate inequalities. I was wondering if there are books that present a different side-- namely, about technology for social good."
booksuggestions,"What are some books that are similar to the Hercule Poirot series by Agatha Christie? One of my friends suggested it and I recently finished ""Hercule Poirot's Christmas"" but I don't want to read another book from the series just yet, although I liked it. I want to explore this genre more. I'd prefer something fairly short and easy to follow."
booksuggestions,So does anyone know a book where like the protagonist is one of the most normal people but gets caught up in some unfortunate series of situations and becomes involved with the underworld... But he raises up to the challenge and becomes a protege of sorts...
booksuggestions,"There's something about these sorts of stories that always intrigues me and creeps me out, whether or not that's the author's intention. Notable examples include Poe's ""The Man of the Crowd,"" Auster's ""City of Glass,"" and Ligotti's ""The Last Feast of Harlequin."""
booksuggestions,"I recently finished The Wind in the Willows and I really loved it. I'm looking for other books like that. I'm not necessarily looking for other books about animals but I want something written around the same time and with the same wholesome feel to it. I read a lot of Enid Blyton as a child so maybe something like that but for older audiences? I don't want it to be aimed for children too much because I think I would get bored with how much of an easy read it would be. 

Thanks in advance!"
booksuggestions,I am looking for good chick-lit books! I also liked Fitness Junkie and The Knockoff. I am just looking for nonstressful books--8 months pregnant and don't want suspense/stressful
booksuggestions,"Just read City of Thieves and loved the relationship that developed between the characters, and it's actually the first book I've finished in almost 4 years, I loved it. So does anyone know any other books with a strong character focus?"
booksuggestions,"It's my girlfriend's birthday soon and I want to get her some books, she loves romance novels and especially enjoys Sophie Kinsella, can anyone suggest some good books like her's? Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated, thanks in advance."
booksuggestions,"Hi!
I’m doing some research and I’ve recently became very interested in banned books. I think it’s very interesting that some books get banned in certain countries and I wanted to compile a list of books banned in the us. I’m not interested in books that are banned for being sexually explicit or obscene I’m more interested in books banned because of radical opinions or forbidden knowledge type deal. I am looking for non-fiction books. The book doesn’t necessarily have to be banned in the us, it could just be a rare book or hidden. Please leave suggestions! Thank you."
booksuggestions,"I'm part of fandoms like Percy Jackson, Divergent, Harry Potter, The Hunger Games etc. and quarantine is like, bleh. Any good book suggestions?"
booksuggestions,I want one where it's a happy ending but would also like to read about how a person faces the rejection from loved ones.
booksuggestions,"Hey all,

I'm a wildlife sciences student with an emphasis on climate change-related conservation and I'm interested in buffing up my natural science knowledge. I'm looking for any relevant books on botany, ecology, wildlife, conservation, climate change, etc. 

So far I'm already familiar with Carl Sagan and Richard Dawkins' works. I've also read Salmon Without Rivers, Uninhabitable Earth, and The Sixth Extinction as recommended by other Reddit users.

Thanks for any suggestions!"
booksuggestions,"One of my favorite series when I was growing up was Kenneth Oppel's Airborn trilogy, which is based in a light fantasy world that's loosely based on the late 20s/ early 30s where zeppelins were a major part of the sort of cultural zeitgeist.  I have just finished reading  (and really enjoyed) the signal airship series by Robyn Bennis which is a steampunk military fantasy.  I'm looking for more books or series that are similar in the sense that they heavily feature airships or zeppelins, but while still maintaining some realism, in other words they don't go too far off the deep end of steampunk fantasy.  Thanks in advance for an suggestions."
booksuggestions,"Now when I say mature I don’t mean naughty books. I mean books that have mature themes in them. I really enjoy books by Stephen King and I am on the last book of the Dark Tower series. So I am looking for a new series to pick up after finishing. I also enjoyed The Stand, and It by Stephen King. 

Another artist I enjoyed was George R. R. Martin. I read all the GOT books that are currently out. I enjoyed the mature storyline so anything like this works too. I’m not to dedicated to any one genre so let me know"
booksuggestions,"Hey,

I was looking for some good psycho thriller books from the point of view from the psycho himself/herself. I didn't really find that good books so maybe you can help me out :)

Edit: Maybe even based on true events!"
booksuggestions,"[""Black train / end credits"" by the blasting company](https://open.spotify.com/track/6MHqsyYYpRyOVmHtrUEWAH?si=cocwY5QwQUyaDttGHH_ecQ) this is the end credits of the cartoon ""Over the Garden wall"" recommend me a book that feels like this song, would be even better if it's tied to a folklore/folky theme"
booksuggestions,"Hello everyone! I'm looking for a fantasy book I can get lost in, and forget about what's going on in the world right now. I just recently started reading again so I know there's a ton I haven't read yet. I'd appreciate the recommendations! :)"
booksuggestions,doesn't matter whether fiction or non-fiction
booksuggestions,I'm looking for books or visual novels that have death as a  character like the sandman and Terry Pratchett
booksuggestions,"Okay, I've been having a really hard time getting back to reading, I used to read 2 books a week until a few years back, but since college started I feel like I've lost touch with reading altogether, and there's so many books I wanna read, but I can't make myself read, reading used to come easily to me but now I feel like I've to force myself to read books, and in the past one year the only things I've read are, unhealthy amounts of Tumblr posts and fanfiction ugh, I really need helppp. The last book I read was the kite runner which was a couple of months back, and I usually like anything engaging and fun. Thank you."
booksuggestions,Can anyone recommend me best translation for On the Nature of Things.
booksuggestions,"My girlfriend and I are looking for books with plenty of sex but without the inevitable part at the end where they fall in love. Sex must be male-female.

Hunting Party by SJ Lewis was perfect
https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6392085-hunting-party

Non consensual sex is okay with us.

Thank you"
booksuggestions,by which i mean a novel with a lesbian protagonist that leaves you with a warm and fuzzy feeling. it doesn't need to be a romance and in fact i prefer it if the romance part is secondary to the main plot but still enough to leave that warm and fuzzy feeling.
booksuggestions,"Apologies for using a manga reference for book suggestions.

To give a synopsis of the manga: Berserk portrays a dark, gore world where everyone dark temptation of human beings is exacerbated in order to show the fallible nature of our world
Therefore, war, destruction and desire to dominate is the norm. 
In such a scenario the two main characters (who are polar opposite) try to find the meaning of their life.

The antagonist finds meaning by letting his desire to develop a nation of his own as his sole purpose. This desire consumes him so much that he willingly abandons his humanity to get the desire. He is broadcasted as the epitome of virtue to his followers but no one knows that he views his followers as nothing.

The protagonist on the other hand, has no grand desire. His attempt to find meaning is limited to be closer to people he cares about most. He dramatically fails in this venture, but this struggle of balancing his trauma  and sadness and overcoming it to form genuine human bond is the thing that humanize him. 

Looking forward to your recommendations."
booksuggestions,"Are there even any books like this that exist, I’ve tried looking online and all that pulls up are fae books with white protagonists."
booksuggestions,"Hi! Thanks in advance for all your suggestions! I am looking for a birthday gift for a female friend. She is not my GF but we have hooked up a couple of times in the recent past. 

I do not want to send the wrong message so i need something not too serious. I know it's a hard thing to ask.

She studies sociology and wants to be an English teacher like hell. She is a free spirit if that means anything to you. 

Please if you need more clues, let me know."
booksuggestions,"Hello! I’m back at school for my second year of college and as you all know, we’re all going to Zoom University now. My course load is PACKED and I’m on my computer 10+ hours a day for school. 

I’m looking for something light, engaging, and easy to read so that I can give my brain a break from my screen/classes.

For reference, here are some books I really enjoyed: 
- {A Discovery of Witches} by Deborah Harkness (read the whole trilogy)
- {A Thinking Woman’s Guide To Real Magic} by Emily Croy Barker (waiting for that sequel to come out...)
- {Such a Fun Age} by Kiley Reid
- {Educated} by Tara Westover

(Would be a plus if it’s written by or features LGBTQ+ characters and/or WOC.) 

Thanks in advance!"
booksuggestions,"Looking for something like this: [https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovesMyAlterEgo](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovesMyAlterEgo). For example, maybe the love interest could be something like a superhero, vigilante, or have an online persona. Alternatively, would also be interested in the MC hating one of the love interest's identities while liking the other. 

My preferred genres are sci-fi, fantasy, dystopian, as well as YA and adult contemporary, but open to others."
booksuggestions,Currently reading “How music works” by David Byrne and I’m loving it. I want to read more books written by the musicians themselves. Any good ones?
booksuggestions,"Hey, my mom usually loves reading, but currently the Body Movers series by Stephanie Bond has put her into a slump. She needs something she'll love to get her back into it. She really liked the Alphabet series by Sue Grafton, and the Stephanie Plum series by Janet Evanovich. Genre isn't super important to her, but she prefers lighter, fun stuff. Can be darkly comedic. No doorstoppers. 
Thanks!"
booksuggestions,"Hi,

I’m looking to read a book on the long term history of Manchester. Does anyone have any recommendations? 

Thanks in advance!"
booksuggestions,I'd like to read a book about what look fwd was like for people after the fall of Rome. Not just the ruling class but for all classes. Also how did people find out there was no Roman Empire anymore. What happened to the Roman Legions out in the hinder land?
booksuggestions,I’m kinda at a loss right now with good fantasy romance books to read. I prefer the books to be written in 1st person and in the new adult genre. Also with smut. Thank you!!
booksuggestions,I’m 17 and just started reading books on my own time and I’m looking for a book that could teach me more about life and motivate me. I’m currently reading rich dad poor dad by Robert Kiyosaki
booksuggestions,Can someone suggest the best business book they have come across ? One that has the right mix of academic and practical stuff and can be read across geographies ?
booksuggestions,"I spent the last few months reading some pretty complex stuff - Gaddis' The Recognitions, Delillo's Underworld, Pychon's Bleeding Edge, etc. I want to get back into reading the classics. But for a breather, I could use a classic novel that is also relatively easy to read (but still compelling). Anyone got suggestions?

Edit : thanks to all for the suggestions!"
booksuggestions,"Recently, I read Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman and Digital Minimalism by Cal Newport. Basically, I need suggestions on books written by PhDs who have documented their life's work or findings from their ongoing projects in their books. These books are not the typical self-help books but have observations and findings from real-world experiments conducted by the researchers."
booksuggestions,I’m just finishing the Scythe series and absolutely loved and missed this genre! Does anyone have any good dystopia suggestions that I can jump into?
booksuggestions,"Educated is a story of resilience and growth. Growth from the place where you find yourself uncomfortable, unwanted, or outcasted.
This book is one of the main reasons why I started writing, making YouTube videos, sharing my thoughts, and in general investing in myself. I learned that educating yourself and being independent are the key abilities that everyone (especially women in modern society) has to have.
It’s about trying to find a way to be who you want to be instead of being a person that everyone else tells you is good to be.
Throughout a life with people who are full of skepticism and hostility in a Mormon family, Tara gets little cues from the world that goes on beyond the mountains from different people and events. She gets bullied into doing and being what other people define a good daughter should be and tries to form herself according to those expectations.
But even those slight, subtle cues make the desire to experience the unknown freedom outside the family appear otherworldly and exciting to her.
The main and most beautiful parts of this book, I believe, are the moments when Tara sees herself in retrospect and starts analyzing her own thoughts and decisions. With this, she gives us a chance to think about ourselves, to maybe see how important some radical decisions can be. To muster the strength and stretch ourselves, to start something new, to immigrate, and to quit the life, job, or relationships we no longer find fruitful.

Alongside all the things we just said, we should also encounter the love of the people who helped us grow and become who we are now. Even when those people don’t accept or approve of what we want to achieve or become in the future, they are worthy of our love because without them, without even our strongest enemy, we wouldn’t have become the person we are today.

Thanks for reading!"
booksuggestions,"I'm writing a story and I can't decide if it should take place during the winter or summer. Can someone help me decide.
Which season has more to write for, e.g. holidays and stuff. My story will last for 4 months."
booksuggestions,"Can anyone suggest books on how to deal with existential dread and feelings of uselessness?

Thank you."
booksuggestions,"Hello all!

I’m a current student spending this year with a 5th grade class (on zoom for now :/) to better understand children’s learning styles, attention spans, and the most effective ways to draw them in and educate them. With my focus being placed on assisting in the construction of a program that will keep kids reading (and off of screens) regardless of how the school year turns out, **I'm wondering if anyone has suggestions for books that have kept this age group particularly engaged**? Thank you in advance for your help!"
booksuggestions,"We're all guys, between 18 and 22. We would like a book  we can discuss about, so maybe some interesting novels. We plan to read a book every month, so a book between 200/300 pages would be perfect. Got any suggestions?"
booksuggestions,"I just finished this book and fell in love with the characters, the warming &amp; funny tone, and the overall plot. Any recommendations that are similar to the vibe of this one? Miriam Toews' other books just didn't appeal to me."
booksuggestions,"This is a little specific, so let me explain. I love reading, but I find it very difficult, and have to take frequent breaks on top of being a slow reader to begin with. So, I find it very hard to get lost in the natural ""flow"" of a story. Because of that, I enjoy books most when each individual sentence is something interesting and compelling in its own right, that I can take pleasure in on its own terms, if that makes sense. So I love authors who make unique or idiosyncratic use of language. Two of my favorite (and very different) authors, for context, are H. P. Lovecraft and Chinua Achebe, and in their own way they each capture their own very specific ""voice"" that I enjoy listening to, even if I've lost track of the larger plot of the story.

However, because of my difficulty reading, a lot of authors who adopt this technique very strongly have thus far been too much of a challenge. I know that James Joyce focuses intensely on the specific use of language, but I've yet to be able to actually *read* one of his books all the way through.

So, I'm wondering about books by authors with a very strong or unique ""voice"", but that are also fairly easy to read and comprehend."
booksuggestions,"I want to read something exciting! Something that I simply can’t put down because I HAVE to know what happens next. 
I really like A Thousand Skies Above You and the sequel to it. I really like Scott Westerfeld and also Neil Gaiman. The Arcana Chronicles were also pretty good. 
I know most of my taste seems pretty YA but honestly some books with less PG themes are more than welcome. I love a good romance and all, and the occasional sex scene is cool, whatever. As long as it’s not like a whole bunch of smut and the romance is preferably not the main theme of said book."
booksuggestions,Which classic work doesn't read up as based in a time overly remote ? And the themes still hold up much of their value.
booksuggestions,"I don’t usually read philosophy but i got interesting in reading some of the books written by classic philosophers, i read a quote by hegel and kinda wanted to try and read one of his books , but i don’t know really where to start , especially that I’m used to reading philosophy books but i would like to give it a shot , any of you has any recommendations about which book should i start with ?"
booksuggestions,"I think my favorite thing about and then there were none is knowing who all the suspects are . I love not being able to trust any of the characters. It would be great if someone can recommend me a whodunit story soon, since I'm going to be quarantining for two weeks soon. It doesn't have to be a story about people being isolated in one location because I'm assuming there are few murder mysteries like that, but if someone can think of one that would be great/ I would like it if the book can have some wit and humor to it. I haven't read it in many years, but I remember liking the quirky, funny writing from The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime. Likable or even charismatic, well written hateable characters are also a big selling point to me. I've been looking at An Unwanted Guest by Shari Lapena, but I saw some mixed reviews. I don't know if anyone here knows what these are, but i recently played some visual novels called danganronpa, 999, and Ai: somnium. If someone here has played these visual novels, they know what type of book I'd probably like.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Some psychological elements would also be good. Like the characters freaking out that there's a murderer among them and then they start to distrust each other

Edit 2: A story where more people get killed over time and major characters get killed off would also be good."
booksuggestions,"Hi, so for my A-Level coursework I need to compare two books of my choice based on a theme, one 20th century and the other 21st. For the 20th century I’ll probably go with A Clockwork Orange because I’m rather fond of it, but I need a 21st century novel to compare and contrast it with. The themes I’m thinking of are generation divide (e.g the contempt between the youth and the adults, and the nadsat slang used by the youth) or evil characters with high taste (e.g alex loving beethoven and other classical music alongside rape, robbery and assault). It doesn’t have to be dystopian but it could help. Also, any other suggestions for themes are more than welcome. Anyone have any recommendations? Thanks in advance :)"
booksuggestions,"
Hello everyone! I’m looking for books similar to Karina Halle’s Experiment in Terror series. I love the blend of humor, horror, and romance. It’s a good mix of everything I’m needing as a distraction from life right now! Stand-alone books are fine, but I’d rather have a series if possible. 

Excited to hear your suggestions!"
booksuggestions,The love that I have by James Moloney or the Movie JoJo Rabbit are examples of what im after.
booksuggestions,"Somebody recommended that I read the Longmire series after I fell in love with the show. Has anybody purchased/read them? If so, is there somewhere where I can either buy them all in one box set for a reasonable price or individually without breaking my bank account? I am weird and don’t like to have some in box sets and some individual... I need everything to look nice and consistent on my bookshelf. Thanks in advance!"
booksuggestions," I am very interested in Norse Paganism. I have read some mythology in books but am wanting to read the poetic eddas and sagas but there are so many authors who have books about them. Which authors are good ones to read this from? If more than one of you recommend the same books/authors, could you let me know please?"
booksuggestions,"Hey, I’m looking for a book that almost as the same hellish atmosphere as the video game Agony, just grotesque and horrifying imagery of hell, and a protagonist trying to maybe get through it"
booksuggestions,"For some time now, I have looking forward to 1- Star reading english stories to expand the variety of books I can read and 2-  Start practicing writting as everyone recommends, with short stories, but I have 0 idea where to find them... have only read a few Asimov tales :P  


Sooo do you guys have any recommendations to join this short fiction world ? I have a preference for fantasy stories but am open to anything niche x) Thank you in advance :p"
booksuggestions,any good mystery books that is sure to make a non reader fall in love with reading?
booksuggestions,This 17-page essay from Sedaris is the perfect quick pick-me-up when you need a good laugh. I downloaded the audiobook with kindle unlimited and couldn’t stop laughing as he recounted his favorite jokes and stories people have told him during his numerous book tours. It’s true that sometimes real life is more absurd and hilarious than anything you could dream up.
booksuggestions,"Hello there! 

I just finished Song of Achilles and it was pretty good, definitely better than Circe (sorry people, I didn’t find it as amazing as most!). Before SoA I read a Darker Shade of Magic which was good but I think I want to wait before starting the sequel. I really am looking for something that’s completely engaging as I don’t feel I’ve read a book in a little while that’s made me lose sleep because I’m so into it. I do like fantasy and have all the usual suggestions on my to-read list but I’m not sure what to start first and not sure I’m drawn to any of them *right now*. I’d love to read something that’s dark and kinda f-ed up (doesn’t have to be though, just something unique, engaging etc), preferably not YA - it seems to be that that’s what I come across a lot?, doesn’t have to be fantasy but I’d say that’s a safe bet and usually what I lean towards, totally fine for it to be a stand alone book but preferably not like a 35689 book series as I don’t think I want to commit to that right now. I am happy for people to suggest the usual fantasy books like Name of the Wind, The Cruel Prince (which I started but not sure about), Mistborn, etc etc but it would be so helpful if you could give me some pointers on how it’s engaging and worth it - because I’m finding it so hard at the moment to get into books due to stress! 

I have a feeling this is kind of vague but I’m hoping someone can help me!"
booksuggestions,"sooooo something kinda like sarah j maas books? nothing too deep you know, just fun and with a compelling romance! i lost my dog yesterday so really i just want to take my mind off things 

(i’ve read all sjms books, all of cassandra clare’s books, most of holly blacks etc - just for some context as to what i’m looking for) 

thank you so much!"
booksuggestions,"I’m looking for some stranger, more “out-there” alternate histories, a bit more bizarre than the usual. Examples I’ve enjoyed recently are Sarah Gailey’s American Hippo, where the US imported hippos as livestock in the 1800s, leading to the existence of hippo cowboys and a problem with feral, killer hippos along the Mississippi, and Greg Bears Dinosaur Summer, where a real Professor Challenger discovered a real Lost World, leading to the existence of dinosaur circuses and finally an expedition to return some of them to the plateau. Anything along those lines?"
booksuggestions,I think this would be an interesting premise for a novel and would love to read a book that touches on this subject.
booksuggestions,"I have a friend who would find CBT very helpful for her day-to-day life. She has a history of panic attacks (not present now). She isn't diagnosed with anything as of now, and has no access to a therapist. As a friend, I have noticed her cycles of self-pity/self-blame, especially during the past few months

What sort of books/(videos on Youtube) could I recommend to her?

If anyone would kindly point me to a better sub (I couldn't find a sub suitable for this question), I would be grateful, thank you.

Edit: She wants my help, I'm not intruding. Sorry, I hadn't mentioned it."

booksuggestions,"Hello, everyone! I'm planning on writing my bachelor's thesis about urban legends in different cultures and I'm looking for recommendations for a short story collection about Japanese urban legends! It's not that I can't find any books, it's more that there are so many that I really can't seem to distinguish the bad ones (everything has ""yokai"" thrown in the title these days!) from the ones that are actually worth the read. Something like ""Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark"" would be ideal, so a book that tells the classic Japanese (urban) legends that mirror cultural knowledge.
I unfortunately can't read Japanese though, so English would be ideal.
Thanks in advance!"

booksuggestions,"I have a very mentally taxing job and like to read at the end of the day to unwind. I was recently working on The Savage Detectives by Roberto Bolano for about a month and had a difficult time reading more than 30 or so pages most days. I picked up In Persuasion Nation by George Saunders as I'm very familiar with his style and I thought short stories would keep my attention but I find myself getting distracted and a little bored after long days. 

I am thinking that the solution might be engaging and easier-to-read biographies about zany people. I have no familiarity with biographies but I can say that I'd prefer reading about truly wacky or odd people; not popular political figures, for example. I am more-so thinking about people who live(d) on the fringes of society or were mainstream but unconventional/idiosyncratic."

1. A History of the Crusades I: The First Crusade and the Foundation of the Kingdom of Jerusalem by Steven Runciman

2. The Crusades: The Authoritative History of the War for the Holy Land by Thomas Asbridge

I heard that Runciman is a little dated in his arguments and has a slight bias toward certain historical interpretations. Be that as it may, which one is more regarded?"
booksuggestions,Just wondering if anyone knows of a good avant-garde or experimental book because I'm having trouble finding any though I know they exist. I'm not interested in traditional literature as I find almost all of it to be boring and similar in how it's presented. I think it would be interesting if I could read a non-linear book that doesn't follow traditional grammatical structure and organization of paragraphs or something that incorporates art that the words of the book conform too. I would also just be interested in the weirdest book you know of in terms of presentation and content.

booksuggestions,"The fundamentals of caring, Come as you are and Paddleton are some of my favourite movies. They're basically dark comedies that deal with heavy themes like euthanasia, chronic illness, loss of a child, disabilities but are still really funny. The characters are kind of apathetic and broken in the beginning but go throw a profound transformation through the course of the film. They're comedy is dry, witty and subtle. I'm looking for a book that has similar themes. 
Thanks in advance."

I want a book that helps me understand what empathy is to the core, how it will help me have better relationships with people(at this point of time, my primary goal is to help face my insecurities and help me develop stronger relations and empathy first with my family members). And what changes i can do to help me become more empathetic.

Honestly, i am not looking for guides, as i feel that if a book convinces me enough with its logic i can work on the aspects my own way(but if you feel there is a guide/how to book that is great, you can suggest)."

booksuggestions,"Essentially ive been going threw an existential crisis which has led to a lack of moral understanding, and identity within myself. Everything feels empty, and meaningless, like nothing matters, and anything I do, or any part of who I am, isn't unique, or meaningful in any way. These past year these feelings have gotten so bad, I have no drive in life, no dreams or passions, and feel so lost with myself I barley even know what name I should call myself anymore. I'm looking for some books that can maybe somehow drag me out of this headspace. Something to bring me back to a sense of purpose, and self, and motivation maybe. Right now I'm thinking of reading ""A Mans Search For Meaning"" by Viktor Frankl. Any other suggestions would be greatly appreciated."

And of course some romance and sexy scenes... I'm open to any different type, however unique and different the plot is, or darker ones are fine. Though I do want one that has a solid, good plot, world-building and characters that aren't bland nor frustratingly 'dumb' (like the kind that u want to shake) or annoying.

booksuggestions,"I have a bleak world view of racism (not just in America, but all over the world) and how it's impossible to solve because of different backgrounds and lack of knowledge. 

I want to change the way I think, I want to be hopeful of the future. 

Is there a book on racism like the book Factfulness by Hans Rosling (a book that gives statistics about how the world isn't as bad as it seems)? 

I am not ignorant of the fact that the world is in a state of figuring itself out so if the book could touch on that it would be great. 

Thank you!"
booksuggestions,"Hello I think to get back to reading I need to read books with shorter chapter. Can anybody recommend some horror, fantasy, or like almost any book with short chapters.

Any help is appreciated!"

Instead of the big, passionate crushes and first loves, I’d love to read about a quiet, peaceful marriage sort of love. The everyday signs of care, etc.

booksuggestions,I keep trying to read a good romance novel that makes you believe in love like most young adult books but also have adult qualities. Most of the ones I've tried are like 50 shades of grey or this man. The males are so controlling and gross. I don't mind bdsm or sex in general but I hate the fantasy of having a man treat you like a child and scold you and tell you what you can and can't do. So if there are any good books that have good healthy romances let me know. I don't care what the genders are that are falling in love I just dont want that alpha male story. Thanks in advance!

I’ve read a few non-fiction books about Nazi Germany and WWII (mostly from a historical point of view) but I realized today that I hadn’t read any similar books about Mussolini’s Italy.

I should add that I am looking for books written in or translated to English only.

Rising up from a bad situation and turning the tables on the other party is honestly so satisfying. I lately have been stuck with reading manga ""villainess"" stories and I am looking for more books that are not manga related. The count of monte cristo was one of my fav books when I was a kid, but I really want a female protagonist this time. Thank you everyone for your assistance!

I struggle to stick to decisions that I make and find that I'm very zoned out through the day. It's gotten to a point where I've begun to feel depressed and I can't understand why exactly. I'm desperate. Please help."
booksuggestions,"So u'all should probably know what book suggestions I want from above, but I'm going to elaborate further.

I've read a couple of books with magic and is similar to Alice in Wonderland, falling through a mirror and discovering in a lovely yet wacky world etc. I love it. It's delightful, and the characters like Mad Hatter are wonderfully vivid and just to my imagination. Usually there's a curse or something, some are deliciously dark or reverse harems, and though they're all similar in a way, its still different snd I love different versions of wonderland and its characters. But is it just me, or it seems that books like that are very few? Ive tried searching it up on kindle but very few comes up.

Anyways, I don't care how long or short it is, how many love interests, how different and unique and twisted or dark the plot is, I just want it all. Except for bad books with few character development, world-building and bland plot of course. They're about the most important things.

ps. and please no gross male abusive stuff, the kind that are simply too much. I said Im fine with dark but some are just plain gag and you simply can't read through"

Who else should I try?"
booksuggestions,"Yes, I know, two strange series to be deliberating between but I've just finished reading His Dark Materials (and all related books) and I fell in love with them. I'm looking for something similar. I love how Pullman writes and I'd like to read something as beautifully written as HDM. I've watched the GoT series and the HP movies (albeit a long time ago) and I can't decide which one would be a better read to follow His Dark Materials. I feel like I should maybe read something more mature like GoT but, at the end of the day, I'm just looking for a good story and good writing that will make me unable to put the book down."
booksuggestions,"So, kinda hard to explain but I need a book that basically talks about a protagonist whos on a vengeance spree and does it in the name of his lord, something like that.

I generally have loved Gillian Flynn-like reads (especially Sharp Objects), but recently read The Silent Patient, which I thought was....so bad (I know that’s maybe a hot take), and also just finished The Seven and a Half Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle and also thought it was only okay.

Since some time I was living with a group of buddies in a large house and it was great. However soon I will be moving to a different country to work where it’s unlikely that I will have close friends, just colleagues. And I’m an extrovert who often needs others for motivation.

booksuggestions,"I’m looking for a book like Snatch or Pulp Fiction, in that the characters are memorable, the dialogue is witty and smart, and I’ll never guess what’s going to happen. Not full of gunfights or action, but always entertaining enough and with high enough stakes to keep me reading."

Even though in the beginning the story took some time to kick start, it was able to shock me at least 4 times. The character development throughout the book was consistent and the introduction of fresh characters was well placed within the entanglement of the tale. The action scenes were well written and much better than the previous 2 narratives. The jaw-dropping ending left me craving for more.

Feel free to give your personal reviews 💜

booksuggestions,"I’m looking for a good introduction to the dualism concept of yin and yang, preferably in a way that not only explains the concepts themselves in a way that makes sense but also relates it to things irl and also how to apply the concepts to enhance your life if possible.

I actually came across one book that seemed like a really good fit for this subject based on the title, Martin Palmer’s *Yin &amp; Yang: Understanding the Chinese Philosophy of Opposites and How to Apply It to Your Everyday Life*, but even used copies of it start around $40 even though it’s just paperback and 160 pages long so I’m guessing it’s that pricey because it’s now out of print? I’d rather not spend that much on the first book I plan on reading about a subject I only have a very surface level knowledge of, but if it’s what’s recommended and is actually really good then that’s what I’ll go for. I just feel like there are cheaper, better options out there.

What do you guys think?"

booksuggestions,"Hi everyone, so I just finished listening to the Dark Tower book series and am sort of at a loss for what to listen to next. I work a job that is filled with long hours of tedious work that doesn't require a massive amount of focus, so I listen to audio books to help move the day along. 

I'm specifically looking for a book series that revolves around a character similar to Roland Deshane from the dark tower series. An uber skilled gunslinger who is either on a long quest or even a series of smaller ones. I like characters like him, Han solo (Star Wars), Malcom Reynolds (Firefly), or basically any pistol toting BAMF like them. I don't mind if the book is set in space, in the old west, or the modern day. The book doesn't even have to be a full blown western, I just like the frontier adventure style feel. 

Some small conditions I would like if possible. One, a good narrator. I've been spoiled with a lot of good audiobook narrators so a great one is a must please. Two, I would prefer if the book focused on the main ""gunslinger"" or at least mostly on them without too much jumping around. Wide scoping books like GoT are cool and all, but not what I'm looking for right now. Lastly, and this isn't really a condition but, if the book is older and set in space/the future I would prefer if its able to hold up to modern ideas of the future (if that makes sense).

Thank you in advance for any help you guys might be able to give!!"

booksuggestions,"Hello there.

I am struggling with my life and just read the midnight library from matt haig. It took me only half a week what is amazing for me because I normally can't read an extended amount of time because it feels so hard to concentrate.

But with this book it was different: the chapters are short, only one timeline, only a few figures. But a lovely story that left me with a warm good feeling. 

Please recommend me some similar books. 

Thank you."
booksuggestions,"Could you suggest a book about crowd psychology or why societies behave the way they do or how they adopt some traditions, for a beginner?"

2. Fantasy books with a black main character I am  a black women and I realized I never read a book  that is fantasy with a black main character I have seen they have them I wanna see what there like. I do like fantasy also just original  fiction plots  are good too like not  completely realistic fiction or something 

3. sweet stories in general I read love and gelato a ya that is popular I loved it and found it sweet 
but it had this  random sexual assault  references especially with the  paintings I found off putting 

I also like Louise penny books which I find sweet suprising but looking for something without homicide"

booksuggestions,"I've been getting back into reading, so started of with straight forward reads like the Hunger Games and Divergent series. I am now looking for any suggestions for standalone novels/stories. Something that's easy to read and is no longer that one book. Open to any suggestions."
booksuggestions,"Hi, me and my best friend and our close social circle have known each other since we were like 3 years old, in the present day most of us are on the way to finishing our college education but he has dropped out of 3 different places out of not knowing what he wants out of life and recently he is pretty depressed because of that. I would love a book that I can read and recommend to him with some insight about what is important and truly fulfilling in life. He actually isn’t quite a fan of reading so maybe something on the shorter side would be easier for him to get into. He is 23 years old. Thank you and sorry if I can’t get my point across very well, English isn’t my main language."
booksuggestions,"I want to explore Russian literature more, don't care about genres (just not young adult please)

Thank you all!"
booksuggestions,"I really enjoyed Circe, did not enjoy song of Achilles as much but it was still good. Any recs? The things I really enjoyed about Circe was the worldbuilding and sense of growth+fantasy/magic element. Thanks in advance!"
booksuggestions,I like to read about the whole situation that happened. I support Palestine because I have seen the in humane things that IDF have done to the civilian Palestinians. Some are straight up ruthless and not cool. However I do not realize why this thing started. Please don’t try to educate me or anything. I will just skip your comment. I rather learn about it myself and pick the truth for myself.
booksuggestions,"the genre i'm looking for is something that changes the entire way you see the world. something that shatters you and makes you ugly cry. but fast paced. 

another genre is psychological thriller/horror. something that poisons you from the inside out and ruins you. something very sharp. something that cuts you from within, and controls your emotions with the characters presented."
booksuggestions,"Hi, I'm new on reddit! I've recently found out that I LOVE humourous books. Well, actually, I don't know if that is the right definition of that genre.
For example, David Foster Wallace is one of my favourite writers. ""A supposedly fun thing I'll never do again"" is my Wallace's favourite. 
That's the kind of books I'm looking for.
My favourite book is Catch 22 (Joseph Heller) and I love the way the narration goes. 
Can someone give me suggestions? Thank you!"
booksuggestions,"The name tends to vary throughout regions, like **1001 Nights** or **A Thousand Nights** or **The Arabian Nights**. Basically, I'm looking for books that either retell the Arabian Nights, have their own version of it, or just are about it.

(Also, kind of a side note, but is the Arabian Nights by Barnes and Noble a good read?)

Edit: I have already read the Wrath and the Dawn :)"
booksuggestions,Hate me for this butttt books about toxic love or intensity in it. I need a break from school books help me out.

2. Homer’s Odyssey 
3. The Name of the Rose 
4. Candide 
5. War and Peace 
6. Romanov 

when i say “knowledge” i mean preparatory knowledge prior to reading the books. ex: what would i need to know about Greek mythology to read the Iliad and the Odyssey?

edit: added a book"
booksuggestions,"Hello everyone. I’m in need of a book following these topics posted above for an English assignment at school. It must be a book of merit and it can be either classical or modern literature. Sorry for waffling but I know that ‘Animal Farm’ and ‘to kill a mockingbird’ would be perfect but I can’t use them as I have already used them in the past. 
Thank you for your suggestions"
booksuggestions,"I just finished this book and i’m honestly destroyed. i knew exactly what was going to happen and i let myself get attached to the character regardless. Anyway, i want another book with the same sort of mass character death. i want to cry. i want lovable characters. there’s no way to avoid spoilers with this ask and i’m ok with that!"
booksuggestions,"Hi everyone, we have a project to think of an old literature from 1900's that can be an equivalent for the new literature today. I'll be using a vemn diagram to compare the two, I hope you guys can help me. Thank you. 

Edit: 1900's and 21st century books are to be compared :)"
booksuggestions,"I have had a lot on my mind lately and I need a book that will fully occupy my mind. Nothing too confusing though, since that will probably prompt my mind to wander.

(Edit: I just realized I should probably state that my favourite genres are fantasy and thriller. My fav author is Stephen King)

Please no graphic rape or sex."
booksuggestions,"I love reading books in nature. The characters can be human or animal. Though, I'd rather not read about the desert. A+ for folks who suggest a book with pre-teens or teens as pov characters. After all said, if it's a good, well written book that takes place in nature, I want to hear about it! - Flinttufft"
booksuggestions,"Access to non-mainstream books that haven’t been translated yet in my country is difficult or just very expensive. I’ve only read Call me by your name, Carol, The song of achilles and the Killing Eve series when it comes to gay books (and I’ve been trying to get Aristotle and Dante discover the secrets of the universe from a trustworthy site and for a reasonable price for like the past 2 years or so). It can also be unrequited wlw/mlm love bc I’m a sucker for pain or a friends to lovers trope"
booksuggestions,"Hello!

I'm looking for some books on modern witches...or just books on modern magic. I'd really like a book that has modern magical elements (tarot cards, potions, spells, divination, etc). I'm not looking for a book that is a how to guide on magic, just a fantasy book with modern magic as an element in it.

Thanks in advance!"
booksuggestions,I really love whodunnit movies and I’ve always wanted to read some books as well. I thought about starting with Agatha Christie but dont know what exactly to pick + maybe you guys have better suggestions and the only reason I want to read her books is that she’s the best known for this genre i guess
booksuggestions,"
Thriller is ny favourite genre, but this quarantine I took a break from it because I get too into books.

Unfortunately I was suggested 'Dont Blink' by James Patterson by a friend and I thought I could read it as a big opener.... But oh boy.... I am so sad... I hated that book. It was lower than mediocre...


Please suggest me a mind blowing book which can improve my bad mood and disappointment"
booksuggestions,"not sure if i can post this. sorry in advanced

looking to read a short non fiction travel book for my class. i wanted to read the geography of bliss but my classmate took it :/ so im hoping theres something similar to that

Here is a prompt my professor gave

""When you have read your chosen book, write a short essay (defined in a dictionary as a “short literary composition dealing with a single subject, usually from a personal point of view, without attempting completeness”)   about an aspect of the book that has to do with travel/tourism. For example, what does the author convey about the value of travel? How does travel change the people in the book? How do travelers “understand” the people they meet and make sense of places? What motives do the characters have for traveling? How do travelers vs. local peoples’ perspectives differ? You need not restrict yourself to these questions. The main idea is to enjoy the book and reflect on its ideas. ""

HERE ARE SOME BOOKS THAT MY CLASSMATES HAVE TAKEN 

*Undaunted Courage*

Travels with Charley in Search of America

The Art of Travel

The Bird Man and the Lap Dancer: Close Encounters with Strangers

Around the World in 80 Trains

Vagabonding: An Uncommon Guide to the Art of Long-Term World Travel

booksuggestions,"I'm in a reading rut right now and don't know what to read. My ""to read"" shelf doesn't tempt me so I decided to ask for some suggestions.

I like to think and analyse very much when I read. So complex or thought provoking ideas, characters, story are extremely welcomed.

(I don't like romance at all) 

Thank you!"
booksuggestions,"Hello, I am looking for a book for my girlfriend specifically something that helps with depression or anxiety.  Something that could take her mind away from things or maybe how other people cope with similar issues would be very helpful. Thank you in advance!"
booksuggestions,"I noticed recently that the majority of books I read are written by male authors, and I want to fix that.
I love scifi, autobiography, memoirs, and sciency non-fiction (like Sapiens, for example) and am trying to expand my horizons, what are the best, specially current books written by female authors that you can reccomend?"
booksuggestions,"Cold war is a very interesting subject to me , would like to learn more."
booksuggestions,I always wanted to read Stephen King work but I never read it yet. And I heard that he made the best horror book. And I don't want book that already adapted into a movie such as Green Mile or It but I haven't watch The Shinning. Can you guys suggest a book that his best one to read?

Suggest me some audiobook.
Few of my recent favourites are: The Shining by Stephen King, The Great Train Robbery by Michael Crichton and To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee."
booksuggestions,"I'm looking for a general overview of the basics. I'm learning Python for fun and Java as part of my college's curriculum. I'm not leaning one way or the other but I am looking for a book to go over a general basic overview of computers, what they do, and obviously tied together with coding."
booksuggestions,"I'm a huge fan of the Bioshock series, and I was wondering whether there were some books that are similar to it. Something like a fantastic world with themes of politics and philosophy, or anything close to that."
booksuggestions,"Hi! Lately I’ve been very invested in human behavior and how it is at it’s rawest form (weird sentence but hang on). I.e say, how humans would act in post apocalyptic scenarios, since those are versions of the present where humans are required to act more on instincts than rely on a capitalistic system. I find the drama and situations that could occur in such a scene very interesting. Basically I would like recommendations of books that explore more what humans do in these survival of the fittest scenarios. Thanks in advance!"
booksuggestions,"I want to get into reading again. I love classics, as well as books that really make you think. I can get behind some dystopian books, coming-of-age, memoirs, but I’m really looking for a book that will wake me up culturally. I like tearjerkers, true stories, or fictional stories. Something cultivating, something tense. I love music and the arts too. I’ll take any recommendations, even classics!

Books/readings I enjoyed: The Glass Castle, The Perks of Being a Wallflower, The Winter of Our Discontent, TKAM, The Stranger, The Catcher in the Rye, So Sad Today, Unabomber Manifesto, The Hate U Give"

Cheers"
booksuggestions,"I've recently searched intently through many online book stores to try and find one that I like, since I have already gotten lucky recently and had one delivered. I ended up liking that one and decided that reading isn't really that bad. But I've actually grown to realize that actually reading the books isn't the bad part, it's trying to find one that matches what I like. Once I get interested in a book, it's really hard to pull me away from it. If you want to recommend a book or book series to me, here are my interests/group:

•14 year old

•adventure

•a bit of suspense

•a bit of mystery/mysterious stuff

•dogs lol


It seems like dog books are really all I read now, since they are the most widespread and diverse type of book that fits my interest, and who doesn't love dogs?"
booksuggestions,I'm looking for a book or anything that shows what happened at 112 Ocean Avenue in Amityville as I'm curious how it inspired the book and movies
booksuggestions,"Hi, I've found that recently I've been getting into books like Leigh Bardugo's The Language of Thorns or stories inspired or based on Jim Henson's The Storyteller. I like that they're short stories and that they carry fairytale-esque and fantasy themes. Any suggestions?"
booksuggestions,Always been interested in her but never  knew where to get started. The longer the better honestly cause I’d like to know more.
booksuggestions,"Sorry if this isn't the right place to post this.

I haven't been able to make it to my local library with their limited covid hours and my crazy work hours. I prefer to own books anyway. But I don't want to order them from Amazon.. I have looked up black owned bookstores near me (northern CT) and I have not found any. Where can I buy/order books from that isn't some huge corporation? 

Thanks in advance"
booksuggestions,I just finished The Silent Patient about five minutes ago. I think it might be the only book I've ever read where I genuinely had no suspicions about precisely where it was going. That was the most exciting experience I've ever had lol Can any of you suggest something in the psychological thriller genre that gave you a similar feeling? I'm so happy right now and I'd love to do that again with a different story.

booksuggestions,"Hi everyone, 

I’ve got a sick family member who has probably a year left Max.  I’ve always been a strictly fiction reader but I was wondering if anyone had any book recommendations that could help me figure my sh*t out and deal with this in a healthy way. 

Appreciate any help I can get, thanks."
booksuggestions,"Sometimes I have problems being able to communicate certain thoughts, ideas and emotions. I was wondering if there are any books that could help me improve my communications skills."
booksuggestions,"Just started can't buy my love and I read how to suppress a few years ago and loved it, but what are some similar books that cover more than just white women's experiences? Preferably written by women authors from the communities they are analyzing pls! (Like a black woman author analyzing black women in advertising or the suppression of black women's writing, etc) 

Thanks in advance!"
booksuggestions,"Something like The Da Vinci Code but about America?

Or an American Government thriller novel?"
booksuggestions,"Can be fiction or nonfiction. I am atheist and believe when we die that is it, the soul is not separate from the body, and there is no afterlife. I recently lost someone close to me, and it’s making want to believe there is something else out there, but wanting to believe something doesn’t make it so, or convince me to believe. So I’m looking for anything that could maybe change my perspective on the subject, and possibly make me more open to belief in some sort of life after death"
booksuggestions,I love the flowers in the attic almost everything about it I love. I sorta connected with petals on the wind and I was really heartbroken by seeds of yesterday. ( if there be thorns sucked though) I think I mostly like how cathy progressed as a character and how much I really relate to her character
booksuggestions,"I’m not a big fan of books where the perspective is from a man. I’ve noticed I also pretty much only read books written by women bc I tend to like the writing style better but I’m open to books from male authors as long as they fit this.

I’m also not into Agatha Christie sorry I’ve tried a bunch but I just can’t get into them. 

Some books I liked are The Last Mrs. Parrish, The Party, The House On Fripp Island, and my favorite, Joanne Fluke cozy mysteries. Some of my favorites non mystery/thrillers would be Class Mom and it’s sequel, My Not So Perfect Life, and In Five Years. 

I guess I’m just looking for a more easy going thriller or mystery that has some twists? A book that catches you as soon as you start reading it, I have a short attention span and I can’t stick to a book if it doesn’t seem interesting on the first couple of pages.

Please suggest any book you think might fit this. Thank you in advanced :)"
booksuggestions,I ran out of credits and now everything I want to read is $20. I'm new to listening to books. Anyone have suggestions for getting free or inexpensive books?
booksuggestions,"Hello! I’m challenging myself to read a book a week for the rest of the year and could use some suggestions! If my calculations are correct that’s about 18 books.

My preferred genres are fiction, fantasy, supernatural, mystery, horror, and adventure but I’m open to anything. I have kindle unlimited and prime reading so it would be a boon if they were available there but not necessary!

booksuggestions,"Hi , i am looking for book with treasure hunting and archeology dig something like elizabeth peters writing."
booksuggestions,"specifically looking for ones that have a lead that is like an “anti-hero” (idk if that’s the right word exactly?) with some kind of sad/tragic backstory or something and is maybe kinda an asshole at first but then gets like a redemption arc or whatever and finds their happily ever after lol. Sorry for the bad/vague descriptions, that’s not really my strong suit lol. Mostly just looking for a book/series that has that classic “bad boy/girl” who’s like actually a total softie when it comes to their LI. Anyways, I’m not super particular when it comes to genre or anything, but I do tend to be partial to fantasy or historical fiction. 

Thanks reddit!"
booksuggestions,"Ok honestly, I have no idea what the common thread is in the books that hook me but I’ve had quite the streak I’ve had to slog through lately. Even award winners with high ratings on good reads, so I’m starting to lose hope. Here are some books that really hit a chord with me, and I enjoyed every page:

Calypso by David Sedaris 
Down and out in Paris and London by George Orwell
The perks of being a wallflower by Stephen Chbosky
What Lie Did I Tell by William Goldman"
booksuggestions,"I have recently encountered Isaac Asimov’s work and have loved every single story of his, some more favorable than others but I want to start reading similar literature by other authors, and by similar I mean literature that talks about space-travel, quantum physics, AI (Robots) , Aliens and etc."
booksuggestions,i want a book that i cant put down. i like young adult lit where it is dystopian but i really don’t want something kiddy. i like dark humor. want it to be sarcastic and witty. it needs to have a romance and i typically like the guy to be a cheeky and flirty character. i want a book that’s gonna suck me in and then probably crush me and have me crying. please put in suggestions of books that you love so much and made you laugh and broke your heart. idk if i want the romance to be the main part of the plot or it can be more about the dystopian stuff but the romance has to be a major part of it tho. give me your best.

I am going through a time where I feel a bit lost and I'm questioning what I really want from relationships, career, life... I would like to read a book that will bring me some guidance, preferably not a self-help book but rather a stand-alone fiction. I enjoy fantasy and romance a lot."
booksuggestions,"I want to read some books on schizophrenia. Preferably a non fiction or textbook, but a fictional story like The Writing On Bathroom Walls would also be welcome. Thanks in advance!"
booksuggestions,"I have really gotten into books such as ready player one, Warcross as well as other Marie Lu books and I also love star wars. So if there are any books that fall into that category?"
booksuggestions,"I really liked how in The Name of The Wind, there are mythological stories of their gods and demons just like we have ours and some of them might be right and some might be wrong and it was very interesting to see Kvothe look into the Myths and Lores of his history to look for clues and to find out which of them really happened and which of them were fake exaggerated stories.

Can you recommend me some book where such a concept is touched, where there are gods and myths and stories inside stories and even they don't know if that's true or not just like our Myths?"
booksuggestions,"All sci-fi is welcome, I'm mostly just looking for some easy reading space adventures, nothing too serious."
booksuggestions,"I really liked the show and would love to read something similar. Good characters, setting and dialogs. Drugs,sex and LGBT."
booksuggestions,"I’m getting into some non-fiction, and found that I really enjoy memoirs/autobiographies about interesting people that had unique life experiences. Some of the books I liked were:

Kitchen Confidential by Anthony Bourdain 

Call the Midwife by Jennifer Worth

Admissions of a Brain Surgeon by Henry Marsh

I liked that they told their own stories, and that they were all a part of niche fields that many people aren’t aware of."

booksuggestions,Looking for a book with a similar narrative style to The Handmaid’s Tale. Not necessarily in the same genre or same issues just the same narration which is described as introspective and nonlinear.
booksuggestions,"I'm currently reading *Albion's Seed* ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albion%27s\_Seed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albion%27s_Seed)) which analyzes the cultures of 4 groups which formed the early United States, with each group corresponding to a region in Britain. Specifically, the Puritans from East Anglia who migrated to Massachusetts, the Cavilers from Southern England who migrated to Virginia, the Quakers from the North Midlands who migrated to the Delaware Valley, and the Scotch-Irish from the Borderlands who migrated to Appalachia. 

I am wondering if anyone knows of a similar book which analyzes the origins, culture, and customs of the early migrants to Canada (not just to New France, but Anglo-Canada as well)."
booksuggestions,"I like most genres of books really, I've been reading a lot of crime/psychological thrillers which I love, but they are getting quite intense and I feel I need something that's gripping in a non serial killer kinda way. I love romance books but I'm going through a breakup so bad idea to read them! I've been reading some good one off books, but I miss the feeling of not being able to put a book down, like when I read Harry Potter and Hunger Games when I was younger. Any suggestions for a series of books that is gonna keep me occupied for a while?"
booksuggestions,"I am new to this subreddit. So here’s a-little back story; I work for a company that requires a lot of driving, when I get to my destination I need to work inside a persons house. 

Music is dull and boring to me these days, morning shows just don’t cut it, I’ve tried to listen to podcast however I have yet to find one that last as long as I need it to (they either get cancelled before the grand finale or they just stop posting) this leaves me very dissatisfied. I like to listen to stuff and see how everything develops, I also prefer something with endings. So if you guys can recommend a great audio book (a series is preferred but not needed )  that fills this void I would greatly appreciate it! Thanks in advance ."
booksuggestions,"So I guess that dystopian books like 1984 and Brave new world are fairly popular but that is not the kind of recommendation I want.

I want books that constructs political systems according to an ideology and then explore human psychology that is influenced by such a system. 

I apologise if the description is too vague."

The Chronicles of Narnia by C. S. Lewis

The Fairyland Series by Catherynne Valente

A Wrinkle in Time and A Wind in the Door by Madeline L’Engle (the rest of the quintet is lovely but not as good imo).

Any suggestions?"

booksuggestions,"I just finished reading Old Bones by Preston and Child (fantastic book, would highly recommend it) and I would like to read more about the party. For those who don’t know, the Donner party was a group of people who, in 1846, left for the West Coast of America. During the winter, the party got stranded in the Sierra Nevada mountains, and eventually had to resort to cannibalism to survive. I want to read more books about them, and learn more about the expedition."
booksuggestions,"Please give me the dirtiest book porn available. I was recently introduced to and really liked the Brides of the Kindred series, so I'm looking for more stuff like that. I've also read fifty shades of grey, so kinky stuff is fine, but I found it pretty meh."
booksuggestions,"One of my seminar topics deals with PTSD and its portrayal in literature, with a specific focus on post-war stories. I am working with stories from Hemingway and Salinger for World War One and Two, but I need some help finding a good source for the Vietnam War.

booksuggestions,"Before today, WoW was just a popular game that a lot of my friends were addicted to, that I didn't want to get into fearing the same fate. Oh and that movie I didn't get to see. But I was borrowed 3 books from 3 different authors about WoW. **ARTHAS Rise of the Lich King** from *Christie Golden* , **Dawn of the Aspects** from *Richard A. Knaak* and **Illidian** from *William King* . So not knowing anything about WoW, which one should I read first. Or ""the beginners guide"" for WoW is something completely different.

booksuggestions,"Ok, so this might sound odd, but I was talking to a friend today about aliens and stuff and I thought that it would be neat to read one of two books: one of them an Arrival type book where aliens show up and are peaceful and try to stop us from nuclear war or something, get us to work together, warn us about some type of future threat, etc. The other where aliens show up and treat humans like humans treat animals (as a whole). So, maybe some would be deemed worthy to be kept as pampered pets for the aliens’ amusement, some humans would be kept in cages, like farm animals, some would have to do labor for the aliens, and then some would be hunted and eaten. I know this probably sounds super weird, but would any of you have any suggestions I could poke around in? Thanks in advance!"

I have Googled around a bit but was wondering if anyone had suggestions. I assume many were likely published in Spanish so hopefully something with an English translation.  

Additionally,  if anyone is familiar with good nonfiction works, I may be interested in those too (although during covid I've found it hard to get into nonfiction unfortunately)."
booksuggestions," It is a series of books. Originally written in Italian and translated into English and other languages... I had read the first book (The Door to Time) and got me hooked up ever since. A splendid book, it is.

Anyone who has a pdf copy, or knows an online store that offers the books?"

booksuggestions,"Hey fellow readers, I moved overseas a few months ago and with COVID, there is nowhere in the foreseeable future that I will get to see my family again. I’m especially missing my sister and our conversations about concepts, ideas, ideologies, and life in general (it just doesn’t flow the same over video chat). I came up with an idea for us to do a “book club” type thing (but with just the two of us) so to give us both a good excuse to dive into a great book and have someone to gush over it with.

She is 15.5 but mature far beyond her years and a seasoned reader. A few books we’ve tried/considered were YA (in the past I’ve generally enjoyed the genre) and it has just lacked that oomph I think we are both looking for, no matter how critically acclaimed. We love character driven stories yet still value and crave a creative plot line. Personally, I’ve been missing richness in a story. I want to get tangled up in the characters, I want my stomach to twist at the dialogue, I want my heart to sink into loving this person who exists only in the written words before me.

I guess most importantly though, we’d want something that would ignite passionate conversation between us and give us some thing to think about.

I think we both don’t mind a good cry, because that means the book is invoking strong emotion. It would be most preferable if the direction of the story wasn’t glaringly obvious, however, the journey is more important than the destination. Sci fi/fantasy is not completely ruled out but not especially thrilled by the idea.

I’m a new mom and she’s starting a new demanding school year online so neither of us has much time to be reading crappy or meh books and I’m really looking forward to seeing what may be suggested to us even with kinda all-over-the-place specifications. Thanks!"

booksuggestions,"Hi! My guilty pleasure at the minute are psychological thrillers. I’ve been seriously in the mood for a really specific type recently. I like mysteries, but ideally not ones focused around police. If you look for thrillers it’s usually loads of  crime detective ones which is where my problem is coming, I don’t enjoy those so much.  

I’m picturing... weird behaviour from a spouse? Maybe they’re cheating, maybe they lied about their identity for years. Family drama, that kind of thing. I read a couple of Claire McGowan ones that I really enjoyed (she writes detective stories too, which I avoided). There was another one called ‘Here to Stay’ that was about a dudes in-laws moving in and refusing to leave. I really enjoyed ‘Before I Sleep’ when I read that as well. 

I appreciate any help finding what I’m looking for! These books have been a real emotional crutch for me the past couple weeks."

booksuggestions,"always loved anything sci fi, but haven't read anything good for quite some time, didn't even look for new stuff untill now

Guess I became somewhat picky with the years, either I find most scifi books really shallow with ,for example, no sense about human psychology, or the book is some forced technobabble, or easily chewable space opera series etc...

For example I adore almost anything by Philip K. Dick... But what else, that is equally good or better?
Also really loved Ursula K Leguin books... Dune, ofc...
Even if it sounds like I am leaning towards some kind of 'high brow' scifi, I am open to all kinds of stuff... I actually liked Ready Player One. ""Commercial"" but at least its fun and fast read. Also, for example I didnt like Snow Crash. Started good , then he lost me with ""babble"" in the middle...Not impressed.  I prefer something I maybe missed in last 10-20 years , but am open to classics also if the book is good... When you are deep in your 30s , it better be really good or I will not bother, life is short(er):)

thankss"

booksuggestions,"Hi folks,

So my partner is furloughed with no end in sight. Searching for work, trying to find some direction in life. She likes Toni Morrison, Audre Lorde, Bell Hooks and other black authors. Her English dissertation was on representations of trauma in black feminist literature. I have a Kindle and access to most e-books, and would like to give her a few titles that might cheer her up and put a bit of joy in her life. The books she has on her shelves are a bit too harrowing to cheer her up, so I'd love to help her out if I can. 

She has a cat, likes craft beer, crocheting, baking, and Star Trek, if that helps?

Thanks in advance,

booksuggestions,"When I was a kid I read this massive book called “The Mammoth Encyclopedia of The Unsolved”. It contained many various chapters on bizarre stories of people like Kaspar Hauser, Philip K Dick, Fedor Kuzmich etc. It’s where I first learned about spontaneous human combustion and was thoroughly freaked out throughout my childhood as well.

The book now is out of date and a lot of things written within it are now out of date. I have not read any books in years and I am wanting to start reading once again, starting with some non fiction. If someone could suggest a modern book with curiosities and mysteries, then I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks!"

booksuggestions,"I love the creativity of the stories in young adult novels, specifically in creating a very interesting world or premesis to the story. Reading book summaries, there are so many interesting stories and worlds invented by YA authors! However now that I'm older I find that they are a bit too juvenile in the way the story is told, and the writing is just not doing the story justice. In many cases I end up being unsatisfied when I finish a YA novel. 

Are there any books that have a unique premise (it can be romance, dystopian, paranormal, fantasy, sci-fi etc) but are written intended for an older audience? I would love to read about a protagonist in thier 20s so that some more complex relationships and themes can be fleshed out.

In general I like books written in the first person where you can really get to hear a characters inner thoughts. Also I would prefer books published in the past 10-15 years or so. Thanks!"

booksuggestions,"Feel free to remove if this isn't appropriate, but I would love to read a good as hell graphic novel. It can be grim, funny, based on real events, and even one that seems to make zero sense. Something with a good story and great drawings. 

Not manga, I don't really like the art style and that, personally, plays a huge part in my enjoyment. Maybe that's an unpopular opinion, I don't know, it's just my personal preference. 

I liked Watchmen, From Hell, The Snowpiercer, Maus, The Silence Of Our Friends, March, Scott Pilgrim (not sure if it's classified as a graphic novel, but anyway). These are the ones off the top of my head. 

Also, I don't really like superhero comics, but if there's one that's REALLY good and that you think I should read then go ahead."
booksuggestions,Not Harry Potter.
booksuggestions,"Amorphous by Peter Craft on Amazon was a trip!. It had Ghosts, Ghouls, Demons, haunted houses, Indians and a flesh eating lawn. An original! Read full book on Amazon for 3 bucks."
booksuggestions,"I picked up *50 True Stories as told by The Moth*, featuring stories told on the radio show/podcast “The Moth,” which I have been listening to a lot recently. Basically, people share personal stories in front of an audience. I was wondering if there are any more books like this or something similar—people telling true stories of their lives."
booksuggestions,"As the title says I'm looking for books to broaden my literature horzion as I realized that the books I read are very eurocentric / white. I would now want to change that and am now looking for books written by Asian/African/South""American/ Native American authors or that are set in one of these regions. I really enjoy books that are (partly) set in the past and that explore family drama/dynamics. Books that I enjoyed reading: The secret History, Everything I never told you, Where the crawdads sing, How we disappeared. I'm not much of a fantasy/horror fan.

Thanks in advance! :)"
booksuggestions,"I've read and enjoyed The Rosie Project, Where'd you go Bernadette, Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine, Normal People, The Storied Life of AJ Fikry, etc. 

By no means does your suggestion need to fall in line with those genres/books.  

Would love a recommendation for a book that's set in modern times with characters as adults not college aged kids or students. Bonus points if it's somewhat humorous.    Thanks!"
booksuggestions,This particular genre interests me but I don't know where to start. Any suggestions?
booksuggestions,Looking for a James Hadley chase type books but with lot of good sex in it.
