,booksuggestions,"The title is pretty much what I'm looking for. I've been reading a lot of different threads trying to come up with a list but it's such a NICHE! I'm about to list off a *bunch* of stuff I look for in books, but **if y'all have something in mind that only checks like 2 boxes I would still love to hear it!**

When I was younger I read CONSTANTLY, but I've found it really hard to get into a lot of books geared towards adults even though I've definitely outgrown YA. **The key (I believe) is the amount I can ""escape"" into the book.** A lot of adult fiction is full of the same mundane problems as the real world and the same suffering we deal with every day. While those stories are important, they're not what I want when I need to take a vacation from this reality.

On the flipside, a lot of Fantasy/Sci-Fi strays so far from the world we know that while the stories are often fantastic, it doesn't quite scratch the same itch in my brain as those oh-so-loved series from childhood. (Percy Jackson- set in the real world, but with GREEK GODS and POWERS and shit. Harry Potter- JK Rowling can piss *right* off ,,however,,,, set in the real world but with MAGIC). It's been really hard to find books that balance Fiction and Fantasy that are also geared towards adults, but a lot of Neil Gaiman's stuff fits the bill. Would love something a little like that if you've got it on your shelves. (Disclaimer, I've been recommended the Magicians series and while I WISH I liked it, I can't stand the narrator, so no need to comment about that one. It does have that exact sort of story, though.)

As an ace nonbinary person, I'd really love to see some **asexual, aromantic and/or nonbinary** characters that AREN'T robots/nonhuman and are accepted within their communities. Also! Would love to see some **well done wlw rep**! wlw relationships are so underrepresented in media, and so many are oversexualized or written for the male gaze. I've had a LOT of trouble finding wlw in adult fiction. :(

I'm also really into **morally-grey characters**, as well as anti-hero types (redemption arcs are welcomed!) but sadly haven't seen much **LGBT rep** in the books I've seen recommended under that umbrella. I think a lot of authors are hesitant to write antagonist-types that are also minorities b/c yikes (gay coding in villains, anyone?), so I definitely get it, but MAN do I want to see some good old 'be gay do crime' that's handled well and fun to read.

**I'd probably prefer:**

\-**NON-YA**: nothing wrong with YA novels, but (as I said) for the most part I've kind of read myself sick of them. Many tend to be geared towards a younger teen audience who are still figuring themselves out and while that is HUGELY important, I'm really looking for some characters who've got a bit more life experience under their belt. Also, it kind of gets under my skin when books explain my own identity to me-- I want to see people I relate to living their lives and having adventures of all types, not just sitting in high school classrooms or googling ""am I gay"" on Google at 2am. Been there, done that, want to see what's next, you know?

\-**Not too explicit**: I'm not *allergic* to sex scenes, but it would be really cool to see adult LGBT rep that's not *super* heavily focused on sex (hence the specific request for ace/aro rep). As an ace person, super explicit sex scenes in books/media often take me out of the narrative a bit, and interrupt the flow of the story. Note that I said ""super explicit"", as in like very descriptive, porno-esque dirty talk, etc. -- If it's implied or not too drawn out, I can just skip it, it's fine. Sex is an important part of a lot of adult relationships so I totally get that it's going to be a part of a lot of books as well, it's just not something I'm interested in so I'd prefer a little less of it in the books I read.

\-**Newer books**: especially when it comes to LGBT characters, a lot of older books tend to either be EXTREMELY subtle or straight-up problematic. not going to absolutely discount anything ""old"", but it seems as far as good representation goes I've found the newer stuff is allowed to be a lot more... honest? with its characters because the world is at least a little bit more accepting and the audiences are (hopefully) more educated.

\-**Character-focused**: I've come across quite a few books that have really awesome characters but so much worldbuilding and exposition and chunks of super plotty sections etc. that I finish feeling like I never really got to delve into what makes the characters great, or just lost interest. (I confess that it's a weakness of mine that I have trouble focusing on the plot if I can't get really attached to a character in some way-- which unfortunately keeps me from being able to fully enjoy some truly good books-- but it is what it is). 

Despite my wishes towards the contrary, I tend to go for stuff that feels a LITTLE bit rom-com. THAT SAID: totally willing to try out all sorts of books, because you never know!

Books like *The Secret History* and *Vicious* have the sort of moral greyness I'm talking about when it comes to the characters themselves, but like I said, I do have a soft spot for lighter narratives (unfortunately those usually don't have too many chaotic-neutral types, ha! too many wishes for one book). I've got *Documenting Light* by E.E. Ottoman on my to-read list, which seems to cover the character-focused LGBT rep aspects.

**Some other books I've read that capture the ""vibe"" of what I usually go for, just for reference:**

*Good Omens* by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett (love the snark, love the humor, LOVE the cleverness), 

*We Are Okay* by Nina LaCour (I KNOW I just said no YA, but what caught me about this book when I read it was the melancholy, the way the scenes were painted, the way it felt like you were really breathing with the characters)

along that same vein is *I'll Give You The Sun* by Jandy Nelson (again, would love something with this feel but older characters!! very much drawn to the artistic aspects as well as the narration, but I'm dead tired of reading YA. I'm an adult, I want to read about some adults please, or at least older teens???)

not a book, but a podcast I like (because of course I do) is The Magnus Archives. It's like paranormal-horror-anthology with really good LGBT rep, and if anyone knows of a book with a similar feel when it comes to characterizations I'm down to try it out!

A trope I will never tire of is the Found Family, so bonus points for that one. Usually pretty common in LGBT reads!

**This post is SO LONG so TLDR: Would LOVE to find some new books with positive ace/aro/nonbinary and other LGBT rep that have well-fleshed out characters. Romance welcomed, morally-grey shenanigans welcomed, wit and snark absolutely welcomed. Preferably a non-YA book. I generally read fiction, and love the type of fantasy where the world as we know it exists, but so does magic-- ESCAPISM is my JAM but gritty/dark storylines are cool as long as it's not gonna depress me for a week :)**

I&amp;#39;ve got &lt;em&gt;Documenting Light&lt;/em&gt; by E.E. Ottoman on my to-read list, which seems to cover the character-focused LGBT rep aspects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some other books I&amp;#39;ve read that capture the &amp;quot;vibe&amp;quot; of what I usually go for, just for reference:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Good Omens&lt;/em&gt; by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett (love the snark, love the humor, LOVE the cleverness), &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We Are Okay&lt;/em&gt; by Nina LaCour (I KNOW I just said no YA, but what caught me about this book when I read it was the melancholy, the way the scenes were painted, the way it felt like you were really breathing with the characters)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;along that same vein is &lt;em&gt;I&amp;#39;ll Give You The Sun&lt;/em&gt; by Jandy Nelson (again, would love something with this feel but older characters!! very much drawn to the artistic aspects as well as the narration, but I&amp;#39;m dead tired of reading YA. I&amp;#39;m an adult, I want to read about some adults please, or at least older teens???)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;not a book, but a podcast I like (because of course I do) is The Magnus Archives. It&amp;#39;s like paranormal-horror-anthology with really good LGBT rep, and if anyone knows of a book with a similar feel when it comes to characterizations I&amp;#39;m down to try it out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A trope I will never tire of is the Found Family, so bonus points for that one. Usually pretty common in LGBT reads!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This post is SO LONG so TLDR: Would LOVE to find some new books with positive ace/aro/nonbinary and other LGBT rep that have well-fleshed out characters. Romance welcomed, morally-grey shenanigans welcomed, wit and snark absolutely welcomed. Preferably a non-YA book. I generally read fiction, and love the type of fantasy where the world as we know it exists, but so does magic-- ESCAPISM is my JAM but gritty/dark storylines are cool as long as it&amp;#39;s not gonna depress me for a week :)&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance! I know a lot of this is a long shot but this community is really wonderful and you guys usually have some solid recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

,booksuggestions,"Hello. 

I'm looking for something to read, which I consider as not typical. 
Specifically, I'm looking for stories that revolves around a main protagonist who's like a golden needle in a rotten haystack. 

I'll cite 10 characteristics of what I seek. 

1. Mostly seen alone, he prefers to utter few words and doesn't waste his time on babbling nonsensical. 
He should be distant, emotionless and reticent, and people who see him--cheerful girls, for instance--consider him boring or weird. 
But, that's just how he is: stoic like a statue in a situation full of drama, unexpressive of his feelings, and may have no feelings. 

2. A kind and lovable human being to his family, yet, he's still retaining his silent demeanor. 
However, he's a devil incarnate to those who will endanger his life and his beloved ones. 
He may have another identity: one shrouded with darkness, death, evil, mystery, and riddles, who his family and people he acquiainted, are unknown and unaware of. 

3. Apathetic and unassuming, he may look like he doesn't care when injustice happens around his line of sight. But, actually, deep inside, is the urge to help out. However, his way of ""helping"" and/or ""saving"" will not be painless and smooth. 
Every self-entitled and spoiled brat heroes always shout, ""Stop this! You're insane!"" or ""This is for my friends!"" or, ""I won't forgive you!"" or, ""That's crazy! Why did you do something like that?!"" whatnot, and then, minutes of skirmishes later, they're lying on the ground like a tortured animal, winning eventually after some insufferable edgy plot armor. 
Unlike those characters, he's a cold-hearted monstrosity that even those he saved may fear him for eternity. 

4. Never ask for any compensation and reward from people who may benefit from what he's done. 
He just wants to do what he must, and leave when he's done. 
However, despotic people, prideful nobles and self-entitled elitist are what disgust the most of him. 

5. Not interested in every inch and nook of body parts of women and never desires to be in a relationship with an opposite sex. 
Not interested in selecting any subordinates to do his work and never intends to pick up slaves to satisfy himself. 
A man who prefers to do things by himself, all on his own. 

6. Stays away from unnecessary conflicts and may willingly do what a person demands. But, should his patience loose, he shall be merciless and unforgiving.

7. Tends to hide his power, skills and strength which he's overpowered, unparalleled, and unrivaled of. But, when situations asked, there's no holding back to do what's needed. 
Inhuman, comprable to a one-man army is maybe an understatement, because he's capable of turning a battle into a one-sided genocide with his own hands. God of Death would be more accurate.
Those who see it, fear him, because of him alone, of what he is, of what he can do. 

8. Even if he puts himself in a bad light, even if it makes people who know him turn to dislike him, and even if it leads to betrayal of his beloved ones to him, he'll never shy away of doing demonic and grotesque things such as killing people in front of their eyes, and not even an ounce of regret thereafter. 
A man who probably enjoys slaughtering those who deseve to kiss death. 

9. Diplomatic meetings, persuasive beggings and smooth talks are not the best thing to resolve a conflict, so, he never wastes his time with doing such. 
He should be capable of assassination, espionage and such that require stealth skills. 

10. One who doesn't get interested and never chase anything related to fame, luxury, status, titles, wealth and women. 
One who prefers to be in the shadows, in the darkness. 

Then, I'll jot down those I came across which I've opinions to relating the subject. 

1. King's Dark Tidings by Kel Kade 
Rezkin is not your typical fantasy hero troupe.
Growing up, he didn't have the peaceful lifestyle of every lowly commoner, nor the privilage of every proud nobility. 
Since birth, he endured treatment worse than slavery; mastered every manner of combat techniques way far than an average, or even an elite soldier; and learned every inch and nook and corners of public knowledge of the world. 
19 years later, the facility that honed him was destroyed, and then, he set out on an adventure, meeting various people and enemies at the same time. 
Whilst Rezkin has most of my criteria, there are so many disappointments as the story progresses. Most of it are the characters he accompanies. 80% of them are annoying and infuriating, and to make things worse, there is so much screen time with them than him. 
Then, there's the relationship that really contradicts his code. I prefer that he just travels alone and meets different people from time-to-time. 

2. Victor The Assassin by Tom Wood 
He's as the books' description depict him to be: cold-hearted, death incarnate. 
But, as strong as those synopsis describe him, as weak as I read of his journey across Russia, Europe, and America. 
Even if he puts on thousands of disguises and impersonation at the same time, his adversaries still manages to catch wind and get to him. And when he do the fighting, it'll only put a little scratch to them. 
When confronted by many, surrounded by numbers, he cannot do anything. He's only good long-range attacks and one-on-one.
Even after those life-and-death situations he barely managed to overcome, and his mysterious past, his skills stays the same, as his enemies are growing up. 
Agent 47 is miles better than him. 

3. Main Character Hides His Strength by Road Warrior 
Feared by all, Sungchul Kim is currently dubbed as Enemy of the World because of some complicated past. Unable to defeat the Demon Lord by Strength alone, he goes incognito to obtain what he needs to defeat him: Magic. 
Sungchul has everything what I'm looking. 

4. Forgotten Conqueror by Za1d3 
Kaidus is a powerful mage who obtained a second chance--reborn into the current era. 
In the past, as Rhultal, driven by vengeance, he was the enemy of the world whose rage had shaken it whole. 
Retaining his knowledge, memories, and power which is now incomprehensible to the present world, as he once again walking upon the lands of Lovis, he seeks out what happened to the world, to his former adversaries since his ""death,"" and the timeframe between it and his resurgence. 
Kaidus has also everything I'm searching, and tops this list. 

*Phew...*

As this list is compose of, it's not limited to just action and fantasy. It can also be an action with LitRPG, mystery, thriller, or action and not fantasy at all and set in a modern world.
A genre where the main protagonist has these 10 preferences, and can unleash them all.

Thanks, in advance.",t2_wso5h,False,,0,False,Stories with a MC that's not a snowflake,[],r/booksuggestions,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_ikh87w,False,dark,0.33,,public,0,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,0,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1598981653.0,text,6,,,text,self.booksuggestions,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m looking for something to read, which I consider as not typical. 
Specifically, I&amp;#39;m looking for stories that revolves around a main protagonist who&amp;#39;s like a golden needle in a rotten haystack. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll cite 10 characteristics of what I seek. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mostly seen alone, he prefers to utter few words and doesn&amp;#39;t waste his time on babbling nonsensical. 
He should be distant, emotionless and reticent, and people who see him--cheerful girls, for instance--consider him boring or weird. 
But, that&amp;#39;s just how he is: stoic like a statue in a situation full of drama, unexpressive of his feelings, and may have no feelings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A kind and lovable human being to his family, yet, he&amp;#39;s still retaining his silent demeanor. 
However, he&amp;#39;s a devil incarnate to those who will endanger his life and his beloved ones. 
He may have another identity: one shrouded with darkness, death, evil, mystery, and riddles, who his family and people he acquiainted, are unknown and unaware of. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apathetic and unassuming, he may look like he doesn&amp;#39;t care when injustice happens around his line of sight. But, actually, deep inside, is the urge to help out. However, his way of &amp;quot;helping&amp;quot; and/or &amp;quot;saving&amp;quot; will not be painless and smooth. 
Every self-entitled and spoiled brat heroes always shout, &amp;quot;Stop this! You&amp;#39;re insane!&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;This is for my friends!&amp;quot; or, &amp;quot;I won&amp;#39;t forgive you!&amp;quot; or, &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s crazy! Why did you do something like that?!&amp;quot; whatnot, and then, minutes of skirmishes later, they&amp;#39;re lying on the ground like a tortured animal, winning eventually after some insufferable edgy plot armor. 
Unlike those characters, he&amp;#39;s a cold-hearted monstrosity that even those he saved may fear him for eternity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Never ask for any compensation and reward from people who may benefit from what he&amp;#39;s done. 
He just wants to do what he must, and leave when he&amp;#39;s done. 
However, despotic people, prideful nobles and self-entitled elitist are what disgust the most of him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not interested in every inch and nook of body parts of women and never desires to be in a relationship with an opposite sex. 
Not interested in selecting any subordinates to do his work and never intends to pick up slaves to satisfy himself. 
A man who prefers to do things by himself, all on his own. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stays away from unnecessary conflicts and may willingly do what a person demands. But, should his patience loose, he shall be merciless and unforgiving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tends to hide his power, skills and strength which he&amp;#39;s overpowered, unparalleled, and unrivaled of. But, when situations asked, there&amp;#39;s no holding back to do what&amp;#39;s needed. 
Inhuman, comprable to a one-man army is maybe an understatement, because he&amp;#39;s capable of turning a battle into a one-sided genocide with his own hands. God of Death would be more accurate.
Those who see it, fear him, because of him alone, of what he is, of what he can do. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if he puts himself in a bad light, even if it makes people who know him turn to dislike him, and even if it leads to betrayal of his beloved ones to him, he&amp;#39;ll never shy away of doing demonic and grotesque things such as killing people in front of their eyes, and not even an ounce of regret thereafter. 
A man who probably enjoys slaughtering those who deseve to kiss death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diplomatic meetings, persuasive beggings and smooth talks are not the best thing to resolve a conflict, so, he never wastes his time with doing such. 
He should be capable of assassination, espionage and such that require stealth skills. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;One who doesn&amp;#39;t get interested and never chase anything related to fame, luxury, status, titles, wealth and women. 
One who prefers to be in the shadows, in the darkness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, I&amp;#39;ll jot down those I came across which I&amp;#39;ve opinions to relating the subject. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;King&amp;#39;s Dark Tidings by Kel Kade 
Rezkin is not your typical fantasy hero troupe.
Growing up, he didn&amp;#39;t have the peaceful lifestyle of every lowly commoner, nor the privilage of every proud nobility. 
Since birth, he endured treatment worse than slavery; mastered every manner of combat techniques way far than an average, or even an elite soldier; and learned every inch and nook and corners of public knowledge of the world. 
19 years later, the facility that honed him was destroyed, and then, he set out on an adventure, meeting various people and enemies at the same time. 
Whilst Rezkin has most of my criteria, there are so many disappointments as the story progresses. Most of it are the characters he accompanies. 80% of them are annoying and infuriating, and to make things worse, there is so much screen time with them than him. 
Then, there&amp;#39;s the relationship that really contradicts his code. I prefer that he just travels alone and meets different people from time-to-time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

,booksuggestions,"I am completely in love with The Magicians, the trilogy by Lev Grossman, and I'm looking for more books (or movies or whatever) like it.

More specifically, I like how the protagonist is aware of his almost endless potential (he's a frickin magician), he knows that he can achieve whatever he sets his heart on, but at the same time he can't find happiness or meaning in his life. 
I think it's meaningful that most of his ""adventures"" start basically because he's unsatisfied or bored or depressed, and not because ""some ancient evil is after him"" or "" he has to save the world"". Sure, after a while it almost always turns out that the stakes are much higher than he anticipated, and the fate of the world actually is in danger, but that's never the fact that sets things in motion.

Hi! I am looking to diversify my reading palette + add some ideas to my Dungeons and Dragons campaign. I really liked The Poppy War by  R. F. Kuang if that helps! Does anyone have any suggestions for something similar to Kuang's book, perhaps with more imagery? I also enjoyed the imagery from God of Small Things by Arundhati Roy.

,booksuggestions,"Hi folks,

I'm a big fan of existentialism and love casually studying the field. I normally juggle 1 fiction book and 1 non-fiction at the same time. I've recently finished my last fiction (Left Hand of Darkness [amazing book]) and close to finishing my non-fiction (The Myth of the State); I'm planning on moving onto the 2nd half of Being and Time and want the next fiction  book to compliment it a bit.

So, does anyone know of any good books that have existentialist themes? I've already read:

&gt; Dostoyevsky's The Double (3/5) and Notes From the Underground (4/5)

&gt; Kafke's Metamorphosis (4/5), The Trial (3.5/5 slow at times but that sorta added to the experience) and The Castle (1/5 I found it very boring)

&gt; Sartre's Nausea (2/5 I get Sartre himself says nothing outside of the themes he's trying to convey are substantial in it but my god it's dull)

,booksuggestions,"My uncle is a 52 year old man, who is very sensitive and prone to depression. He enjoys calm things, like spending time with his dog, or chilling at home. Family is very important to him. He's gone through some setbacks, divorced his wife 10 years ago (now remarried), his mother's (my grandmother) illness, and recently lost his job, but found another one.

He is not an active person, but I feel he really seeks human connection, and the simple beauties in life.

I'm looking for some books I could gift him to his birthday.

### The book in a nutshell:

Why are humans so powerful?

**Cognitive revolution:**

* We could communicate more information about the surrounding world
   * This allowed better planning and complex actions
* We could gossip
   * Up to 150 people could cooperate
* We invented fiction (Religion etc.)
   * Cooperation between EVEN more than 150 people!
   * Rapid behavior change! (Independent of our genes)

**Agricultural revolution:**

* We started producing our food for ourselves, so we had more food per area and then we multiplied
* We also started writing and using money

**Scientific revolution:**

* We admitted ignorance and started using the scientific method.
* Capitalism created growth
* We started believing in progress!

### How the past shaped us

* The agricultural revolution and everything from there on is the blink of an eye, compared to our years of hunting and gathering. So our bodies aren’t optimized for our modern environment
   * That’s why we binge on sweets and greasy food.
* Foragers needed more skills and knowledge about the natural world than we do today
   * Today we only need specialized knowledge about our work, while relying on others for everything else
* We rose quickly to the top of the food chain compared to other species.
   * This is the reason that we are still filled with fears and anxieties because we used to be in the middle of the food chain.

# Cognitive revolution

* Accomplishments from 70,000 to 30.000 years ago:
   * Boats
   * Clothing
   * We traveled to Australia
   * We made the first known art.
* Living conditions:
   * Most sapiens lived on the road
   * They ate a more varied diet and were less likely to suffer from malnutrition.
* It’s believed they were animists
   * So they believed that all objects have feelings, desires, awareness and could be communicated with.
* Humans jumped to the top of the food chain:
   * We have walked on two legs, used tools, had complex thinking and complex social structures for millions for years
      * Still… It’s only in the last 100.000 years that we jumped to the top of the food chain
   * The proposed reasons we jumped to the top of the food chain:
      * We could communicate more information about the surrounding world
      * We could gossip
      * We invented fiction

# The agricultural revolution

* We started producing food for ourselves
* This required settling down to one place
   * We significantly altered the places to suit our needs.
   * We treated animals in cruel ways
   * Luxuries (food) become necessities and often produce new responsibilities
   * We started worrying about the future because we somewhat had control over it and it affected the production of food.
   * People worked more but got a worse, less varied diet.
* Since more food was available per area, humans multiplied exponentially.
   * Thereby, increasing our evolutionary success, because we get more copies of our DNA.
* Money
   * The first kind of money (barley) was used 5000 years ago
   * Money is the most efficient and most universal system of mutual trust

# The scientific revolution

* It’s only in the last 500 years, that there has been a connection between science, technology, and war.
* Before the scientific revolution, most people didn’t believe in progress
* We started working according to clocks in the industrial revolution, because we only produced parts of products, and thereby were dependent on other people showing up.
* Families and local communities used to be the norm but were now replaced with the state and the market.
   * You used to be as good as dead if you left your family and local community
* We became individuals:
   * Choosing who we marry (Instead of our parents influencing us)
   * Choosing our job (Instead of working in the family business)
   * Choosing where to live (Even if we can’t visit our family weekly)

### Why did the Europeans rule the world when we weren’t more advanced technologically?

1. Modern science.

* Three Characteristics:

1. Admitting we don’t know (ANKI)
2. Focus on observations and mathematical models
3. Possibility of new technology

* When the British conquered other countries they brought scientists with them
   * When they conquered India they examined ruins that Indians had ignored and discovered the first Indian civilizations.
* Science is often financed with political, economical or religious agendas

1. Capitalism

* Economic history = Growth
* We achieved growth by creating credit (Loaning from the future)
   * The reason we haven’t done this before is that, before the scientific revolution, people didn’t believe in progress.
   * Capitalism works when profits are reinvested in production
* Should markets be completely free?
* Slaves were sold to make sugar for Europeans because it made sense from the perspective of supply &amp; demand.
   * Ethical considerations should also be made
   * Profits should be gained in a fair way

### Advancements in the scientific revolution

* Good things about our advancements:
   * In the nineteenth century, hospitals were still cutting off soldiers’ arms and legs (without anesthetics), because we didn’t know about antibiotics and sterilization methods.
   * All production used to come from the muscles of humans and animals.
      * Then came the steam engine, electricity, etc.
      * In the seventeenth hundred England, 1/3 of children die before age 15, while today it’s only 7 out of 1000.
   * Things have gotten more peaceful
      * In 2000 only 1.5% died because of war and violent crimes.
      * Reasons that we have less war:
* Bad things about our advancements:
   * Bad for all animals
   * Bad for the living environment we can live in.
* Today supply has outpaced demand
   * So what should buy all this stuff?
      * Consumerism is born

# Other topics from the book:

### Happiness

* It’s not an evolutionary advantage to be happy all the time. Happiness needs to fade, so we are motivated to pursue new things.
* We tend to stabilize at some happiness level, which is different for everyone.
* What makes us happy?
   * Money helps up to a certain point
   * Family and community is important
   * Illness doesn’t affect long-term satisfaction
      * Unless:
* Happiness depends on our expectations
   * This is why mass media and advertising can destroy our happiness
* Different perspectives
   * We only experience happiness because of chemicals in our body
   * We experience happiness if our life seems meaningful and worthwhile.
   * According to Buddhism our happiness neither depends on external events nor internal feelings

### Meaning of life

* From a scientific view, no meaning seems to exist for humans
   * The planet could go on existing without us.

### Humans are moving towards unity / Globalization

* From a birds-eyes-view, humans have moved towards bigger and more complex civilizations
   * 12.000 years ago we had thousands of disconnected human worlds that didn’t know about each other
   * 500 years ago we had just 5 disconnected worlds, where one of them contained 90%
   * Now all previously disconnected human worlds are influenced by each other. No original/authentic culture exists
* Factors that facilitated the movement towards unity
   * Money
      * Reciprocity didn’t work with strangers, who would never return the favor.
      * Trading was inconvenient
      * The soviet union tried gathering and distributing according to everyone’s needs
   * Empires
      * We are all shaped a lot by the roman empire, Arab caliphate, and the European empires
      * In the 19th century the British empire covered more than half of the globe, and spread European ideas and norms, like:

### Religion:

* Most religions started as animism
   * Believing all object have awareness and desires
* Then things turned towards polytheism
   * Because if there only was a single god, he wouldn’t have desires and biases
   * But often they still had some kind of universal creator
* The first monotheist religions started around 350 BC.
   * Before this, there were also beliefs about an all-encompassing faith/atman, but now god also had biases and desires.
   * Monotheistic religions were more missionary
   * Doesn’t make sense why evil exists, if an all-encompassing loving God created everything.
* Dualist religions
   * Believe in the battle between good &amp; evil.
   * Are better at explaining why evil exists
   * Doesn’t explain the common laws between the fight of the good and the evil.
* Other religions like Buddhism, Daoism, Confucianism, cynicism, and stoicism believed in natural laws, rather than divine will.
   * According to these religions: If gods exist, they are also governed by the same laws.
   * Buddhism believes the cause of suffering is craving, which is a product of the mind. Wanting bad things to go away and wanting more of the good things.
* The book also sees communism, liberalism, nationalism, Nazism, etc. as religions
   * 3 types of humanists

1. Liberal humanists: Every individual is sacred and should have freedom
2. Socialist humanists: The collective is sacred, so we should have inequality
3. Evolutionary/Nazi humanists: We should help those races with good genes while getting rid of the rest.

### How homo sapiens are different

* Most other species have close relatives
* Multiple species of humans existed before us, and many at the same time, but the last one died 10.000 years ago.
   * Our closest ancestor now is the chimpanzees
   * Two theories of why the other human species went extinct
   * The interbreeding theory: We mated and mixed with the other species
      * There is some proof of this. Europeans DNA is 1-4% the same as Neanderthal DNA.
      * The replacement theory: We killed all other species
      * Most likely it is a mix of both
   * Humans are born prematurely compared to other species
      * Therefore, there is more time to educate and socialize the children
      * Tribes are needed for help because women can’t take care of these prematurely born children.
* The most unique thing about our language is that we can talk about things that don’t exist
   * Examples of things that only exists in our collective imagination:
      * Religion, gods, nations, laws, justice, human rights, money, companies.
   * Three things that maintain these fictions

1. They are manifested in the physical world
2. They shape our desires

* “Follow your heart” was implanted in our minds with romantic myths in the nineteenth century
* Romantic ideas of having as big a variety of experiences as possible
* Holidays
   * Egyptians build pyramids, but would never travel
   * Consumerism

1. They exist across almost all peoples minds

* Why is fiction so powerful?:
   * Biology sets the foundation, while fiction allows us to play more complex games.
      * We can change behavior based on fiction (nations, laws), while most animals can only change based on genetic alterations and environmental changes.
   * But they allow extremely flexible cooperation
      * Individuals in other species can only cooperate with a few trusted others or their relatives.
      * When looking at individuals one by one, we are not that different from chimpanzees, but the way we can cooperate and build on top of each other is what makes us powerful.
      * No other species engage in trade
* We write
* We first began writing about 5000 years ago
   * The first writing was for record-keeping (taxes)
   * Writing changed our thinking
* Homo sapiens destroy/change the environment more than any other animal.
* No other species cares about the rest of the species
* We probably only care because of the recent globalization/movement towards unity
* All other animals have a “us and them” mentality
* The things that are considered masculine and feminine varies across time and cultures.

### The end of sapiens

* We can change the course of nature with intelligent design (Biological engineering)
* Since we are motivated by saving lives, and science helps us in this pursuit, we are likely to move towards of world of superhumans

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The book in a nutshell:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why are humans so powerful?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cognitive revolution:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We could communicate more information about the surrounding world

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This allowed better planning and complex actions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We could gossip

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Up to 150 people could cooperate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We invented fiction (Religion etc.)

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cooperation between EVEN more than 150 people!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rapid behavior change! (Independent of our genes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agricultural revolution:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We started producing our food for ourselves, so we had more food per area and then we multiplied&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We also started writing and using money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scientific revolution:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We admitted ignorance and started using the scientific method.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capitalism created growth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We started believing in progress!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Overall timeline&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;13.5 billion years ago: Big bang&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4.5 billion years ago: Planet earth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3.8 billion years ago: First organisms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5-7 million years ago: First human ancestor evolved from the apes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 million years ago: Humans traveled through continents and evolved into different species

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Homo sapiens evolved from the ones (Homo erectus among others) that had traveled to East Africa&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;300.000 years ago: We started using fire daily&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;150.000 years ago: Homo sapiens date back to this date at least&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;70.000 years ago: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cognitive revolution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;12.000 years ago: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Agricultural revolution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10.000 years ago: Now homo sapiens are the only type of humans left.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;500 years ago: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scientific revolution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;How the past shaped us&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The agricultural revolution and everything from there on is the blink of an eye, compared to our years of hunting and gathering. So our bodies aren’t optimized for our modern environment

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That’s why we binge on sweets and greasy food.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Foragers needed more skills and knowledge about the natural world than we do today

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Today we only need specialized knowledge about our work, while relying on others for everything else&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We rose quickly to the top of the food chain compared to other species.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is the reason that we are still filled with fears and anxieties because we used to be in the middle of the food chain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Cognitive revolution&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accomplishments from 70,000 to 30.000 years ago:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clothing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We traveled to Australia&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We made the first known art.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Living conditions:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most sapiens lived on the road&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They ate a more varied diet and were less likely to suffer from malnutrition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s believed they were animists

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So they believed that all objects have feelings, desires, awareness and could be communicated with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Humans jumped to the top of the food chain:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have walked on two legs, used tools, had complex thinking and complex social structures for millions for years

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still… It’s only in the last 100.000 years that we jumped to the top of the food chain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The proposed reasons we jumped to the top of the food chain:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We could communicate more information about the surrounding world&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We could gossip&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We invented fiction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The agricultural revolution&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We started producing food for ourselves&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This required settling down to one place

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We significantly altered the places to suit our needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We treated animals in cruel ways&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;We started worrying about the future because we somewhat had control over it and it affected the production of food.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People worked more but got a worse, less varied diet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since more food was available per area, humans multiplied exponentially.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thereby, increasing our evolutionary success, because we get more copies of our DNA.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Money

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first kind of money (barley) was used 5000 years ago&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Money is the most efficient and most universal system of mutual trust&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The scientific revolution&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s only in the last 500 years, that there has been a connection between science, technology, and war.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before the scientific revolution, most people didn’t believe in progress&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We started working according to clocks in the industrial revolution, because we only produced parts of products, and thereby were dependent on other people showing up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Families and local communities used to be the norm but were now replaced with the state and the market.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You used to be as good as dead if you left your family and local community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We became individuals:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choosing who we marry (Instead of our parents influencing us)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choosing our job (Instead of working in the family business)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choosing where to live (Even if we can’t visit our family weekly)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Why did the Europeans rule the world when we weren’t more advanced technologically?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modern science.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Three Characteristics:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Admitting we don’t know (ANKI)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on observations and mathematical models&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Possibility of new technology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the British conquered other countries they brought scientists with them

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When they conquered India they examined ruins that Indians had ignored and discovered the first Indian civilizations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Science is often financed with political, economical or religious agendas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capitalism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Economic history = Growth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We achieved growth by creating credit (Loaning from the future)

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The reason we haven’t done this before is that, before the scientific revolution, people didn’t believe in progress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capitalism works when profits are reinvested in production&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should markets be completely free?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slaves were sold to make sugar for Europeans because it made sense from the perspective of supply &amp;amp; demand.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ethical considerations should also be made&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Profits should be gained in a fair way&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Advancements in the scientific revolution&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good things about our advancements:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the nineteenth century, hospitals were still cutting off soldiers’ arms and legs (without anesthetics), because we didn’t know about antibiotics and sterilization methods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All production used to come from the muscles of humans and animals.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then came the steam engine, electricity, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the seventeenth hundred England, 1/3 of children die before age 15, while today it’s only 7 out of 1000.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Things have gotten more peaceful

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2000 only 1.5% died because of war and violent crimes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reasons that we have less war:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bad things about our advancements:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bad for all animals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bad for the living environment we can live in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Today supply has outpaced demand

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So what should buy all this stuff?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consumerism is born&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Other topics from the book:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Happiness&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s not an evolutionary advantage to be happy all the time. Happiness needs to fade, so we are motivated to pursue new things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We tend to stabilize at some happiness level, which is different for everyone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What makes us happy?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Money helps up to a certain point&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Family and community is important&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Illness doesn’t affect long-term satisfaction

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unless:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Happiness depends on our expectations

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is why mass media and advertising can destroy our happiness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Different perspectives

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We only experience happiness because of chemicals in our body&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We experience happiness if our life seems meaningful and worthwhile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to Buddhism our happiness neither depends on external events nor internal feelings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Meaning of life&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From a scientific view, no meaning seems to exist for humans

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The planet could go on existing without us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Humans are moving towards unity / Globalization&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From a birds-eyes-view, humans have moved towards bigger and more complex civilizations

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;12.000 years ago we had thousands of disconnected human worlds that didn’t know about each other&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;500 years ago we had just 5 disconnected worlds, where one of them contained 90%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now all previously disconnected human worlds are influenced by each other. No original/authentic culture exists&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Factors that facilitated the movement towards unity

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Money

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reciprocity didn’t work with strangers, who would never return the favor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trading was inconvenient&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The soviet union tried gathering and distributing according to everyone’s needs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Empires

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are all shaped a lot by the roman empire, Arab caliphate, and the European empires&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the 19th century the British empire covered more than half of the globe, and spread European ideas and norms, like:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Religion:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most religions started as animism

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Believing all object have awareness and desires&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then things turned towards polytheism

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because if there only was a single god, he wouldn’t have desires and biases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But often they still had some kind of universal creator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first monotheist religions started around 350 BC.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before this, there were also beliefs about an all-encompassing faith/atman, but now god also had biases and desires.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monotheistic religions were more missionary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doesn’t make sense why evil exists, if an all-encompassing loving God created everything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dualist religions

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Believe in the battle between good &amp;amp; evil.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are better at explaining why evil exists&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doesn’t explain the common laws between the fight of the good and the evil.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other religions like Buddhism, Daoism, Confucianism, cynicism, and stoicism believed in natural laws, rather than divine will.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to these religions: If gods exist, they are also governed by the same laws.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buddhism believes the cause of suffering is craving, which is a product of the mind. Wanting bad things to go away and wanting more of the good things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The book also sees communism, liberalism, nationalism, Nazism, etc. as religions

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 types of humanists&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liberal humanists: Every individual is sacred and should have freedom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Socialist humanists: The collective is sacred, so we should have inequality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evolutionary/Nazi humanists: We should help those races with good genes while getting rid of the rest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;How homo sapiens are different&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most other species have close relatives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple species of humans existed before us, and many at the same time, but the last one died 10.000 years ago.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our closest ancestor now is the chimpanzees&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two theories of why the other human species went extinct&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The interbreeding theory: We mated and mixed with the other species

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is some proof of this. Europeans DNA is 1-4% the same as Neanderthal DNA.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The replacement theory: We killed all other species&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most likely it is a mix of both&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Humans are born prematurely compared to other species

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore, there is more time to educate and socialize the children&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tribes are needed for help because women can’t take care of these prematurely born children.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most unique thing about our language is that we can talk about things that don’t exist

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Examples of things that only exists in our collective imagination:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Religion, gods, nations, laws, justice, human rights, money, companies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Three things that maintain these fictions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are manifested in the physical world&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They shape our desires&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Follow your heart” was implanted in our minds with romantic myths in the nineteenth century&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Romantic ideas of having as big a variety of experiences as possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Holidays

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Egyptians build pyramids, but would never travel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consumerism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They exist across almost all peoples minds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why is fiction so powerful?:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Biology sets the foundation, while fiction allows us to play more complex games.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can change behavior based on fiction (nations, laws), while most animals can only change based on genetic alterations and environmental changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But they allow extremely flexible cooperation

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Individuals in other species can only cooperate with a few trusted others or their relatives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When looking at individuals one by one, we are not that different from chimpanzees, but the way we can cooperate and build on top of each other is what makes us powerful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No other species engage in trade&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We write&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We first began writing about 5000 years ago

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first writing was for record-keeping (taxes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing changed our thinking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Homo sapiens destroy/change the environment more than any other animal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No other species cares about the rest of the species&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We probably only care because of the recent globalization/movement towards unity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All other animals have a “us and them” mentality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The things that are considered masculine and feminine varies across time and cultures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The end of sapiens&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can change the course of nature with intelligent design (Biological engineering)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since we are motivated by saving lives, and science helps us in this pursuit, we are likely to move towards of world of superhumans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was it...&lt;/p&gt;

,booksuggestions,"Educated is a story of resilience and growth. Growth from the place where you find yourself uncomfortable, unwanted, or outcasted.
This book is one of the main reasons why I started writing, making YouTube videos, sharing my thoughts, and in general investing in myself. I learned that educating yourself and being independent are the key abilities that everyone (especially women in modern society) has to have.
It’s about trying to find a way to be who you want to be instead of being a person that everyone else tells you is good to be.
Throughout a life with people who are full of skepticism and hostility in a Mormon family, Tara gets little cues from the world that goes on beyond the mountains from different people and events. She gets bullied into doing and being what other people define a good daughter should be and tries to form herself according to those expectations.
But even those slight, subtle cues make the desire to experience the unknown freedom outside the family appear otherworldly and exciting to her.
The main and most beautiful parts of this book, I believe, are the moments when Tara sees herself in retrospect and starts analyzing her own thoughts and decisions. With this, she gives us a chance to think about ourselves, to maybe see how important some radical decisions can be. To muster the strength and stretch ourselves, to start something new, to immigrate, and to quit the life, job, or relationships we no longer find fruitful.

Alongside all the things we just said, we should also encounter the love of the people who helped us grow and become who we are now. Even when those people don’t accept or approve of what we want to achieve or become in the future, they are worthy of our love because without them, without even our strongest enemy, we wouldn’t have become the person we are today.

Even though in the beginning the story took some time to kick start, it was able to shock me at least 4 times. The character development throughout the book was consistent and the introduction of fresh characters was well placed within the entanglement of the tale. The action scenes were well written and much better than the previous 2 narratives. The jaw-dropping ending left me craving for more.

,booksuggestions,"Hi everyone, so I just finished listening to the Dark Tower book series and am sort of at a loss for what to listen to next. I work a job that is filled with long hours of tedious work that doesn't require a massive amount of focus, so I listen to audio books to help move the day along. 

I'm specifically looking for a book series that revolves around a character similar to Roland Deshane from the dark tower series. An uber skilled gunslinger who is either on a long quest or even a series of smaller ones. I like characters like him, Han solo (Star Wars), Malcom Reynolds (Firefly), or basically any pistol toting BAMF like them. I don't mind if the book is set in space, in the old west, or the modern day. The book doesn't even have to be a full blown western, I just like the frontier adventure style feel. 

Some small conditions I would like if possible. One, a good narrator. I've been spoiled with a lot of good audiobook narrators so a great one is a must please. Two, I would prefer if the book focused on the main ""gunslinger"" or at least mostly on them without too much jumping around. Wide scoping books like GoT are cool and all, but not what I'm looking for right now. Lastly, and this isn't really a condition but, if the book is older and set in space/the future I would prefer if its able to hold up to modern ideas of the future (if that makes sense).

For example, what does the author convey about the value of travel? How does travel change the people in the book? How do travelers “understand” the people they meet and make sense of places? What motives do the characters have for traveling? How do travelers vs. local peoples’ perspectives differ? You need not restrict yourself to these questions. The main idea is to enjoy the book and reflect on its ideas. ""

So my partner is furloughed with no end in sight. Searching for work, trying to find some direction in life. She likes Toni Morrison, Audre Lorde, Bell Hooks and other black authors. Her English dissertation was on representations of trauma in black feminist literature. I have a Kindle and access to most e-books, and would like to give her a few titles that might cheer her up and put a bit of joy in her life. The books she has on her shelves are a bit too harrowing to cheer her up, so I'd love to help her out if I can. 

She has a cat, likes craft beer, crocheting, baking, and Star Trek, if that helps?
