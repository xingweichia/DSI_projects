,audiobooks,"So I am sucker for The Great Courses Plus (tgcp). A year and half back I got bored of watching of tv shows and reading books (nothing seemed to interest me) and I found tgcp. On and off when i get time, I subscribe and watch courses. So I watched some of them and wanted to rate them and write a sentence or two about why you should get them on audible (or subscribe to tgcp, upto you). 

1. A History of Hitler’s Empire by Thomas Childers- The first ever course I completed on tgcp. Man, it was amazing. Some might find the way he talks a little odd but i found it very alluring. He has a way of talking that makes the whole course seem ominous, dark, and seems like he really really knows hitler. He tries to explain how hitler thought and how germany was back then. Definitely recommend 6/5

2. How Great Science Fiction Works by Gary Wolfe- He explains all the themes of science fiction and delves into its history. Okay, this one is real good provided you don’t mind mild spoilers or have read a lot of science fiction books. Personally I haven’t read many scifi books, so I felt like many of them got spoilt (not exactly spoilers, he tells what the main theme of the book but doesn’t spoil the story, my fault for getting annoyed, but I still finished the entire series because it was good). So 4/5. But if you are a person who doesn’t care about the premise of the book and is more into the writing and buildup, then you wouldn’t mind this course and the little ‘spoilers’ it has. 

3. Modern Political Tradition by Lawrence Cahoone- This course is must take to understand politics. It will provide a solid base for you to dwell further into political philosophy/theory or hold your ground in a political debate with your friends/online (because now you would have understood and heard the terms they  are using) or at the very least, do clever shitposting on political subreddits. 5/5

4. The Great Tours African Safari by James Currie- Handsome South African guy takes a very good and passionate course on African  safari in a South African accent. Absolutely amazing. However I think you need to watch this course on video format (because you know, he shows pictures and videos of animals).  5/5
(disclaimer- i still have 4 episodes remaining to finish it) 

5. World War II by Thomas Childers (again)- This one is a very fleshed out course on WW2 and he includes all the fronts and the reason I love his courses are - he includes a lot of context. He tells you the way leaders thought back then. Why they took the steps they did. Frankly it’s amazing 6/5 
(disclaimer- i still have 14 episodes remaining to finish it and yet i still recommend it because that’s how good it is!)

6. - The US and The Middle East: 1914 to 9/11 by Salim Yakub- Man I have been binging this for the past two days. Extraordinary. Absolutely unbiased &gt;!despite the guy being affected by the crisis in lebanon during 1970s!&lt; 7/5 
(disclaimer- i still have 5 episodes remaining to finish it) 

7. A History of the United states by multiple authors - This one just like thomas childers and salim yakub’s courses is frickin amazing! Similar to both of them, these authors go in depth and explain the world at that time instead of stating facts and leaving it there. Definitely recommend and is 84 episodes long. Definitely worth the audible credit ! 
(disclaimer- i still have 67 episodes (lol) remaining to finish it, but absolutely worth the marathon) 7/5

8. Algebra II by James Sellers and Precalculus by Bruce Edwards- This needs to be watched on video (because they do math problems). I didn’t expect math courses to be good, but damn they really are, I am currently halfway through both of them and definitely recommend them to anyone who had a bad history with math in school and wants to do them again or just wants to learn them for fun. I recommend other math courses by the same professors, because they teach really really well (I wish I had them in school). They have calculus and higher courses by Bruce Edwards. 5/5

8. Meteorology by Robert Fovell- Oh man, he explains it so well and makes science sounds so easy and intuitive ! 5/5
(disclaimer- i still have 14 episodes remaining to finish it)

Other courses that I have started and reached like till episodes 5-10 and would rate them 5/5 are, (i will write about them some other day when I finish more courses)

1. Everyday Engineering by Stephen Ressler
2. Nature of Earth: Intro to Geology by John Renton 
3. Law School for Everyone by multiple authors

One course I didn’t like was Mysteries of Modern Physics: Time by Sean Carroll and gave up on episode three and would give it a 2.5/5

(disclaimer- i still have 14 episodes remaining to finish it)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other courses that I have started and reached like till episodes 5-10 and would rate them 5/5 are, (i will write about them some other day when I finish more courses)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyday Engineering by Stephen Ressler&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nature of Earth: Intro to Geology by John Renton &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Law School for Everyone by multiple authors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One course I didn’t like was Mysteries of Modern Physics: Time by Sean Carroll and gave up on episode three and would give it a 2.5/5&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit- thanks &lt;a href=""/u/thereyes""&gt;u/thereyes&lt;/a&gt; for giving me an award :)&lt;/p&gt;

I am an addict for romance stories, the crazier the better. I especially enjoy listening to audiobooks since I can “read” whenever! Today I want to share with you guys a few of my top romance audiobook picks! **If you have any recommendations for audiobooks you think I might like in this genre, please share them in the comments!**

&amp;#x200B;

* A Cry in the Dark by Denise Grover Swank

This book had my hooked from the start. The story is filled with many edge of your seat moments. So many twists throughout the story that I kept second guessing what was going to happen. Needless to say what I had expected to happen didn't and I loved that I couldn't predict the ending.

&amp;#x200B;

*  Cold &amp; Deadly(Cold Justice: Crossfire #1) by Toni Anderson

Ava Kanas and many other FBI agents are attending retired FBI agent Van Santos funeral when a sniper takes out one of their own. Ava is sure that Van Santos' death was murder not suicide but no one seems to want to listen…

I loved the way the relationship between Dominic and Ava played out. While they may have had an instant attraction, the actual relationship took time to build. I couldn’t get enough of the tension it created. The mystery, the action, the intrigue, the romance, I was riveted!

&amp;#x200B;

*  Sweet Temptation by Cora Reilly

""I’d never been a man for the sweet things in life, I suddenly craved it.""

Oh my gosh! I'm completely blown away by this book. This was the perfect single dad, age/gap, arranged marriage, MAFIA story. So Freaking Good!

&amp;#x200B;

* The Truth About Lies by Aly Martinez

Cora is basically a den mother and a slave to her Guerrero family ties, and Penn is the new maintenance man with a wicked back story that will break even the coldest heart.

What can I say, It’s intense, fun, heartbreaking, raw, gritty, emotional and romantic… Another fan-freaking-tastic romantic suspense by Aly Martinez!!

I have a friend who is 75 years old and she loves to listen to audio books. With Covid19 and all the associated stuff happening, her usual go-to resource, her local library - is now closed and she can't access any CD books to take with her to her bi-weekly dialysis treatments.

The Gardener of Baghdad is a historical fiction I wrote more than six years ago. It is currently discounted at chirpbooks for $3.99. 
If you have any inquiries about the novel or about Baghdad, I will be more than willing to address them. A quick glimpse about the novel:

""Two people, one city, different times; connected by a memoir. Can love exist in a city destined for decades of misery?""

A newbie to the community here. Nice to get acquainted with you all. I’m a young entrepreneurially minded and independently working writer/poet from Iceland. I need some audiobook suggestions from you professionals to listen to during my upcoming road trip through mainland Europe.

Really don’t want to waste precious driving time only listening to music while I could be educating myself. Some books I already like are books about entrepreneurship like Think and Grow Rich and Rich Dad Poor Dad as well as biographies of successful people in all professions.

I also like good fiction. Being a writer myself, working on a novel, it wouldn’t hurt listening to a good novel that might hone my own story writing skills or provide inspiration. Novels with positive messages like The Life of Pi and the Alchemist are among my favorites. Really don’t like any downers or disturbing thrillers. 

All suggestions based on the books I mentioned would be greatly appreciated!

I narrated this book and would love to give you the FREE summer nostalgia escape we all deserve right now in exchange for a fair and honest review on audible.

When 19 year old Nate Burton is appointed the new manager of a local movie house it's not exactly the promotion of his dreams.  He's got a diva projectionist, rowdy customers, a thieving concessions counter girl, and that new automated projector keeps trying to eat the movies.   If that weren't enough he only got the job because the last manager was murdered in the theater parking lot and the suspects are everywhere possibly even in his own staff.  Meanwhile, another monster is on it's way.  It's 1975 and JAWS is about to change summer movies forever.

I’m also starting to think audiobooks is a part of those bad instant gratification habits that I’m trying to lose, but I’m not sure. Its so much easier to start listening to something than to grab a book, as listening can be done with only half of my concentration.

Fair warning: this isn't thinking man's speculative fiction, so don't expect some kind of allegorical treatise on modern society. My book--as you can't plainly see on the cover--is filled with toilet humor, terrible dad jokes, and thinly veiled pop culture references that probably only appeal to listeners who were alive when film-making peaked in 1998. That being said, I did get a couple of jabs in here and there.

This book does have outtakes at the end. You can get a taste of those [here](https://bit.ly/SlabSteeleFlareUps) if you want.

I tried downloading a visual novel, and it loaded up just fine. I tried downloading another audiobook (""You Should See Me in a Crown"") and it started playing immediately. I tried to start Ballad up again, and it just keeps giving an error message.

I have been interested in audio based stories alot lately,since I drive for work I eventually get tired of listening to music and end up listening to creepy stories 
I started my own YouTube channel last week that serves creepy and mysterious stories!
I've had some positive feedback from alot of people but one constant criticism is with the visual aspect! I'm still trying to find a balance with satisfying those visual viewers while having the story be independent of video.
Please feel free to take a listen on my video...I currently have only 2 videos up!

**The Djinn Tamer Bronze League boxset is a complete LitRPG trilogy with plenty of progression and monster-battling elements, perfect for fans of** ***Pokémon*** **and** ***My Hero Academia.*** 

Jackson Hunt dreams of becoming a professional monster tamer - to capture, power up, and battle creatures called Djinn. But dreaming of becoming a champion and actually achieving mastery are two very different things. 

Before he can ever become a champion, Jackson must tame his first monster - a wild, feral Djinn left to him by his dead mother. And then there’s the small problem of fighting in illegal underground tournaments. 

Join Jackson and his team of Djinn as they level up, tame new monsters, and battle their way to the top of the league. Skills will be tested, powers unleashed. Victory won’t come without a cost.

Hope you're all having a great day! So I know how annoying it can be to try and find a new good audiobook read. Most of the time go through books, check what's good, then hop over to whichever service, search it up, and audiobook!  Or we know some good narrators or authors and check them out on our audiobook services until they feed our cravings!

Oh wait, you listen to your audiobooks on google play, or an audiobook service that isn't Audible or iTunes? No problem, we have links to Kobo, Google Play, Storytel, and others.

,audiobooks,"I'm up to date with that serie, and I'm kinda feeling tired of it.

I just finished Oathbringer and feel like even if the next one was already available, I wouldn't download it.

I *felt* that there was no ending in sight, and Wikipedia just told me that I was merely on 3 out of a 10 projected books before hoping to get closure.

I really like the creativity of Sanderson : the sprens, the ecology, the multiple dimension, the long lost civilizations, the magical world and the way the characters are finding out about it. 

I like the light touch of humour and the way characters are evolving, the unveiling of their past crimes and bad ideas and where they are now.

But, what I thought at first to be an epic journey to reach a comprehensible goal is already making me feel like when I was reaching  the 4th book of Craig Alanson in that Expeditionary Force serie : it's a freaking soap opera!

The rythme is good and I feel like things are going forward, there is action, people dying, people joining in, new adversary that turn ally, there is a couple of major twists about what we thought was going on but turn out to be the opposite, yeah, I like that...but *where is this going?*

Are they gonna kill the bad guy (of course they are), are they gonna find how they where able to make a whole civilization switch dimension (yeah, of course)....but I'll have to plow through the whole life of those characters before witnessing it.

And for a reason I'm not able to express clearly (because I like a lot of aspect of that serie), I really don't feel like it. The writing is good, has it's moment, but is not exceptional. I often feel there is no weight behind some scenes.

I think it's on me in great part, I like closure, I like a final point to a paragraph and I like to understand ""the message"" the author is trying to pass along...

But I don't feel like surfing on a story line taking thousand of hours to kill the bad guy though.

,audiobooks,"Hello, all! 

**Some backstory:** 

I've recently delved into audiobooks, which are rekindling my love of pleasure reading after a two-year stint without the free time to do so (who woulda thunk a Master's program in English would make you *read* so much?). I started with the first book in *The Wheel of Time* saga, and was pleasantly surprised at the consistency of quality of the recordings. Ready to dive into audiobooks headfirst, I started collecting everything I could get my hands on for cheap or free, including some older recordings of Isaac Asimov's *Foundation* saga. Having made audiobooks my main companion during a daily commute of about an hour per direction, I was surprised (and more than a little disappointed) at the quality of the transfer - the audio was a little thin, there was a constant hum, and the general volume was quiet enough to be barely audible even cranked to max volume on my car's stereo. 

Being a hobbyist musician and knowing my way around Audacity and other DAWs (namely Ardour), I just *knew* there had to be a way to save the recordings. After much tinkering, a little bit of research, and plenty of hair-pulling, I managed to work out a system I liked, and got it working as an effective macro in Audacity - so much so that I need only open one file to capture some data and then automate the entire rest of the task of improving the mp3s. 

Bear in mind, I'm a complete novice when it comes to audio engineering, and there's only so much that can be salvaged from a poor transfer, but here's the process I've found to be most effective when dealing with converted audiobooks. Hopefully, this will be useful for anyone looking to improve MP3s found on the web or trying to convert their own tapes to digital. 

**The part you actually clicked for (**[and an imgur gallery to illustrate](https://imgur.com/a/kaBy2ag)**):**

Whether or not I'm working by macro, my first step is *always* noise reduction. Conversions from tape, unless properly edited after the fact, retain that tape hiss that can be overbearing at times. Audacity's plugin in for this is perfectly passable, and only requires me to grab a moment of the hiss to use as a noise profile. Given these files tend to be fairly low-quality, I've found no issue with letting Audacity be aggressive with this step. 

My next step is a Filter Curve (if so desired, the same effect can be accomplished via a Graphic EQ, but this worked best for me). The curve you use is entirely dependent upon the needs of the audio file, but generally, you want to cut out the low bass, moderately boost the mids, and more heavily boost the highs. Some rules of thumb are to cut anything under 60Hz, put one peak (\~2/3 of your max volume) around 200-300Hz, and max out anything above 6000Hz. 

After this point, I usually get some peaks that are dangerously close to clipping, so I use Audacity's Normalize to keep everything as loud as possible without distortion (or at least any more distortion than the recording already had). To allow any room for additional processing, I normalize to -2.0db. 

Next, I run a compressor. This part isn't strictly necessary, but just in case the filter curve's pushed the audio farther than can be handled in a low-bitrate file (the files start at 64k, and are exported at 64k), this reins everything in. Like the normalization, this allows for the most amplification without distortion. 

By this point, I usually notice a bit of that hiss returning (the quieter the source file, the more amplification, and the more anything left behind by the first noise removal resurfaces). Running noise reduction again, with the same settings, tends to do the trick and leave the silences crystal clear. 

My macro uses another round of Normalization for safety's sake (this round normalizes everything to -1.0db, to give the maximum volume without clipping), then everything is exported back out as MP3 in the same bitrate as before. The file sizes tend to be just a little bit larger than the source files, but only by a hair. 

As an added step, I like to use MP3Tag to get all the files properly numbered - it's much quicker than doing everything in Audacity's menus, as MP3Tag can automatically number and bulk-edit tags, and is absolutely necessary when using the macro en masse, as the macro doesn't retain any tag data. 

The process isn't terribly time-consuming, and running it as a macro on multiple files only requires grabbing that noise profile before starting the entire process (as the hissing or other noise is pretty consistent across files). Lately, I've been dumping entire audiobooks into the macro at once and coming back half an hour later to check the results.

**TLDR for the impatient:**

To improve quiet and hissy audiobooks converted from tape in Audacity:

* Run Noise Reduction
* Apply a filter curve that cuts out frequencies under 60Hz, boosts 200-300Hz, and maximizes 6000Hz+
* Normalize to prevent clipping
* Compressor to limit dynamic range and prevent clipping
* Run Noise Reduction a second time to clear out any remaining hissing
* Normalize for safety
* Export as MP3
* Tag/Number with MP3Tag

,audiobooks,"Hello Reddit Audiobooks!

My name is Michael R. Miller, author of *The Dragon's Blade Trilogy*. I'm a huge fan of audio books. In fact I listen to more books than I read these days. As a child I was hooked on Stephen Fry's narration of Harry Potter, the Alex Rider books on tape, and later got back into reading by listening to Mistborn by Brandon Sanderson on audio. So when I published my own series I had to have audio editions made.

Some months ago I bundled my entire series into one long audio book bundle at 46 hours long. It's been doing well and I think people are really valuing the length for the credit in these crazy times. So I'm here to let you know it's a thing and if you're a fan of epic fantasy / sword &amp; sorcery you may wish to check it out!

It's a story of redemption, for an arrogant dragon prince who is reborn, secretly raised by humans, and must learn to become the king his past self never was.

In terms of tone I'd compare it to Brandon Sanderson - grit in the story and characters but little swearing (one F word in book 3), not much gore, and just one sex scene which tastefully fades to black. It's an adult book but anyone from 14+ should be able to read and enjoy it.

,audiobooks,"[**The Living Dead**](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Living-Dead-Audiobook/1250755247), a present-day zombie novel by George A. Romero and Daniel Kraus is coming in August, with narration by Ken Foree and Bruce Davison. (18 hrs)

The early reader reviews from [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52379448-the-living-dead) are solid, and it's got some terrific author blurbs:

&gt;“*The Living Dead* is a sprawling, timely, scary epic that honors the zombie tradition but also goes in new directions and takes risks that pay off.”―Paul Tremblay, author of *A Head Full of Ghosts* and *Survivor Song*  
&gt;  
&gt;“If *Night of the Living Dead* was the first word in the dead rising field, *The Living Dead* is the last word. A monumental achievement.”―Adam Nevill, author of *The Ritual*  
&gt;  
&gt;“Like a lost Romero classic, which will play out on the inside of your skull long after you've finished it.”―Clive Barker  
&gt;  
&gt;“A work of gory genius marked by all of Romero's trademark wit, humanity, and merciless social observations. How lucky are we to have this final act of Grand Guignol from the man who made the dead walk?”―Joe Hill, *New York Times* bestselling author of *The Fireman*  
&gt;  
&gt;“Every zombie movie lives in the shadow of Romero, but he never got the budget to work at the scale he deserved. Fortunately, Daniel Kraus delivers the epic book of the dead that Romero began. That shadow just got a whole lot bigger.”―Grady Hendrix, author of *My Best Friend’s Exorcism*  
&gt;  
&gt;""\[A\] phenomenally enrapturing and reverberating work of art. Vividly illuminates the minds of the characters.”―*Booklist* on *The Shape of Water* by Guillermo del Toro and Daniel Kraus

Here's the publisher's summary:

&gt;***New York Times*** **best-selling author Daniel Kraus completes George A. Romero's brand-new masterpiece of zombie horror, the massive novel left unfinished at Romero's death!**  
&gt;  
&gt;George A. Romero invented the modern zombie with *Night of the Living Dead*, creating a monster that has become a key part of pop culture. Romero often felt hemmed in by the constraints of film-making. To tell the story of the rise of the zombies and the fall of humanity the way it should be told, Romero turned to fiction. Unfortunately, when he died, the story was incomplete.  
&gt;  
&gt;Enter Daniel Kraus, co-author, with Guillermo del Toro, of the *New York Times* best seller *The Shape of Water* (based on the Academy Award-winning movie) and *Trollhunters* (which became an Emmy Award-winning series), and author of *The Death and Life of Zebulon Finch* (an *Entertainment Weekly* Top 10 Book of the Year). A lifelong Romero fan, Kraus was honored to be asked, by Romero's widow, to complete *The Living Dead*.    
&gt;  
&gt;Set in the present day, *The Living Dead* is an entirely new tale, the story of the zombie plague as George A. Romero wanted to tell it.

Ken Foree was Peter in **Dawn of the Dead** (1978). It will be fun to hear him return to the zombie apocalypse. Added to my wish-list!  


UPDATE:  
Ken Foree is no longer listed as a narrator. :(  
Lori Cardille is now listed as a narrator :)

How lucky are we to have this final act of Grand Guignol from the man who made the dead walk?”―Joe Hill, &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;The Fireman&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Every zombie movie lives in the shadow of Romero, but he never got the budget to work at the scale he deserved. Fortunately, Daniel Kraus delivers the epic book of the dead that Romero began. That shadow just got a whole lot bigger.”―Grady Hendrix, author of &lt;em&gt;My Best Friend’s Exorcism&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;[A] phenomenally enrapturing and reverberating work of art. Vividly illuminates the minds of the characters.”―&lt;em&gt;Booklist&lt;/em&gt; on &lt;em&gt;The Shape of Water&lt;/em&gt; by Guillermo del Toro and Daniel Kraus&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the publisher&amp;#39;s summary:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;best-selling author Daniel Kraus completes George A. Romero&amp;#39;s brand-new masterpiece of zombie horror, the massive novel left unfinished at Romero&amp;#39;s death!&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;George A. Romero invented the modern zombie with &lt;em&gt;Night of the Living Dead&lt;/em&gt;, creating a monster that has become a key part of pop culture. Romero often felt hemmed in by the constraints of film-making. To tell the story of the rise of the zombies and the fall of humanity the way it should be told, Romero turned to fiction. Unfortunately, when he died, the story was incomplete.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter Daniel Kraus, co-author, with Guillermo del Toro, of the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; best seller &lt;em&gt;The Shape of Water&lt;/em&gt; (based on the Academy Award-winning movie) and &lt;em&gt;Trollhunters&lt;/em&gt; (which became an Emmy Award-winning series), and author of &lt;em&gt;The Death and Life of Zebulon Finch&lt;/em&gt; (an &lt;em&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/em&gt; Top 10 Book of the Year). A lifelong Romero fan, Kraus was honored to be asked, by Romero&amp;#39;s widow, to complete &lt;em&gt;The Living Dead&lt;/em&gt;.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set in the present day, &lt;em&gt;The Living Dead&lt;/em&gt; is an entirely new tale, the story of the zombie plague as George A. Romero wanted to tell it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ken Foree was Peter in &lt;strong&gt;Dawn of the Dead&lt;/strong&gt; (1978). It will be fun to hear him return to the zombie apocalypse. Added to my wish-list!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br/&gt;
Ken Foree is no longer listed as a narrator. :(&lt;br/&gt;
Lori Cardille is now listed as a narrator :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best,&lt;/p&gt;

Looks pretty intriguing! Here's a [Teaser Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS4mGesO2m4).

Publisher's description:

&gt;***Please note:*** *This content is not for kids. It is for mature audiences only. Just like the original graphic novels, this audio adaptation contains explicit language and graphic violence, as well as strong sexual content and themes. Discretion is advised.*  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Hailed by the *Los Angeles Times Magazine* as ""the greatest epic in the history of comic books,"" *The Sandman* changed the game with its dark, literary world of fantasy and horror—creating a global, cultural phenomenon in the process. At long last, Audible and DC present the first-ever audio production of *The New York Times* best-selling series written by acclaimed storyteller Neil Gaiman (who also serves as co-executive producer). Adapted and directed by multi-award-winner (and frequent Gaiman collaborator) Dirk Maggs, and performed by an ensemble cast with James McAvoy (*It, Parts one and two*, *X-Men: First Class*, *Split*) in the title role, this first installment of a multi-part original audio series will transport you to a world that re-writes the rules of audio entertainment the way that *The Sandman* originally re-defined the graphic novel.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;When The Sandman, also known as Lord Morpheus—the immortal king of dreams, stories and the imagination—is pulled from his realm and imprisoned on Earth by a nefarious cult, he languishes for decades before finally escaping. Once free, he must retrieve the three ""tools"" that will restore his power and help him to rebuild his dominion, which has deteriorated in his absence. As the multi-threaded story unspools, The Sandman descends into Hell to confront Lucifer (Michael Sheen), chases rogue nightmares who have escaped his realm, and crosses paths with an array of characters from DC comic books, ancient myths, and real-world history, including: Inmates of Gotham City's Arkham Asylum, Doctor Destiny, the muse Calliope, the three Fates, William Shakespeare (Arthur Darvill), and many more.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;A powerhouse supporting cast helps translate this masterwork into a sonic experience worthy of its legacy, including Riz Ahmed, Kat Dennings, Taron Egerton, Samantha Morton, Bebe Neuwirth, Andy Serkis, and more. Setting the stage for their performance is an unprecedented cinematic soundscape featuring an original musical score by British Academy Award winner James Hannigan. Fans will especially revel in a new twist for the audio adaptation: Neil Gaiman himself serves as the narrator. Follow him as he leads listeners along a winding path of myths, imagination and, often, terror. Even in your wildest dreams, you’ve never heard anything like this.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;This first installment of the audio series *The Sandman* adapts volumes 1-3 of the graphic novel series (*Preludes &amp; Nocturnes*, *The Doll’s House*, and *Dream Country*).  
**Estimated run time:** 10hrs 50mins

[https://www.catholicculture.org/audiobooks](https://www.catholicculture.org/commentary/category/audiobooks)

A good amount of what we put out is writings from the first few centuries AD--the authors known as the Fathers of the Church, whose writings were hugely important in Christian history and thus in the development of Western civilization. For non-Christians or non-Catholics, the best known figure from this period would be St. Augustine. So far we have mostly done fairly short works, but we are about to start our more ambitious project yet--an unabridged recording of Augustine's massively influential book On Christian Doctrine.

In addition to these ancient writings we do some more recent things, especially by St. John Henry Newman, who was reputed as the greatest English prose writer of the 19th century.

We have also just started getting into some dramatized readings--such as St. Thomas More's Dialogue of Conscience, a riveting record of his last conversation with his daughter before he was beheaded by King Henry VIII.

Occasionally we venture further afield, as with our recording of Nobel Literature Prize winner Aleksandr Solzenitsyn's famous Harvard commencement speech. We have done some poetry readings too, and at some point may try our hand at fiction if we find something really good.

,audiobooks,"This is just a little rant I wanted to get off my chest, but I hate when there's no digital version of an audiobook available...anywhere. 

For a book club I'm part of, we have to read The Icarus Hunt by Timothy Zahn. He seems to be a fairly popular author with works in the Star Wars series, but this particular book was published in 1999, so the only audio version out there is on cassette.

I bought a hardcover off abebooks for $5 thinking it wouldn't be a big deal to read by the end of the month but I am struggling. The last physical book I read was A Court of Wings and Ruin in 2017 because they changed the narrator, and as the 3rd book in the series I couldn't deal with it at the time. Before that it was Breaking Dawn of the Twilight Series in 2008.

I learned around the time of my AP English summer reading (in 2007) that audiobooks are the best way for me to get through books, and I never looked back. I recently talked to my doctor about possibly having ADHD and she confirmed I likely have it (at age 29!) which further solidifies why audiobooks are so great for me. I usually listen on my commute to &amp; from work, or since COVID and working from home, I listen while playing some more casual video games. Staring at pages and being able to do NOTHING else at the same time drives me crazy. 

Having to actually sit down and read a book that only mildly interests me for this book club is proving to be a more frustrating experience than I anticipated. I love books for the stories they tell, but hate the physical act of reading a book (blasphemy I know) so this experience has reminded me to appreciate all of the books that do have audio, or older ones that have been digitized. They make books so much more accessible to people for a variety of reasons.

,audiobooks," I remember when I first came across the idea of audiobooks. I was in 4th I guess (around 9-10 yrs old). As an Indian, english isn't my first language, it is second, you may even call it third. Yeah, I know four languages (Marathi, Hindi, English, and Gujrati). Lot of Indians know atleast 3 languages. 

I was close to my english teacher as I was a 'decent' and interactive student then. I wanted to improve my accent and also be able to understand foreign accents much easily, so my teacher recommended me to listen to audiobooks instead of reading books. I didn't pay attention to her advice and instead, started watching TV shows. Foolish me preferred google's advice over that of my teacher's (But, it helped though)

I again considered listening to them when I was in 8th. I had never listened to an audiobook in my life, not even a sample. I just thought of it once when my teacher mentioned it few years back from then. 
Google Assistant had recently launched, and I was excited as Android was finally getting a personal assistant like IOS. And foolishly, without even checking, I thought that audiobooks are for blind people who can't read and that it will be narrated by Google TTS Voice, same as google assistant. So again, I gave up the idea of listening to audiobooks!

It was last year, that I got into audiobooks. It was a break and my friend was sitting alone on first bench in the class with her earphones on. I was, as usual, sitting at the back with my friends, enjoying, as if we had no other jobs in our life. I called her to join us. She didn't respond. I called her second time and she still didn't respond. So I got up and walked towards her to see what was up with her. I went, sat beside her, removed a earphone from her ear and put it in mine. She wasn't listening a song. In just few seconds I knew that it was a paragraph from Harry Potter. I listened for few more minutes, then I picked her phone up, and saw the cover on her lockscreen saying, ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, read by Stephen Fry"". I listened for few more minutes and then removed the other earphone from her ear, took her phone, left the class and went to the washroom and kept listening until my school was over (Bunked all other classes for the day).

,audiobooks,"I'm having trouble finding new fantasy books to listen to. I've listened to most of the recommendations I see commonly on this sub. 

I tend to enjoy darker/grittier books, but would be interested in things which aren't grimdark. I have not liked any of the litRPG I've tried, but am open minded about the genre. I also try to avoid unfinished series, or series without at least two books out. I avoid anything narrated by Stephen Brand, which is unfortunate because I think he narrated some good books. Also, I'm only interested in books available as audio.

Below is a list of what I've read. I included some quick thoughts about some of them.

* Farseer - Robin Hobb. I enjoyed the first trilogy although I found it pretty slow paced. I'll probably listen to the Tawny Man trilogy but am not in a rush
* Greatcoats - Sebastien de Castell. Fun listen, I enjoyed the sword fighting scenes. Overall found it pretty average though
* The Dagger and the Coin - Pete Bradbury. Good concept, felt like a lot of filler, I wouldn't recommend it
* Dawn of Wonder - Jonathan Renshaw
* Broken Empire - Mark Lawrence. Has some flaws, but it's probably my favorite series on this list.
* The Goblin Empire - Katherine Addison. I tend to avoid books not part of the series, but really enjoyed this one.
* The Demon Cycle - Peter Brett. Painted Man is one of my favorite fantasy books, but I struggled to finish book 4 and haven't attempted the 5th.
* The Cycle of Arawn - Edward Robertson. Didn't finish, mostly stuck with it for Tim Gerard Reynolds
* Powder Mage - Brian McClellan
* Drizzt books - I really enjoyed these, read about 10 of them
* Bridei - by Juliet Mariller. I wish there were more things narrated by Michael Page
* The Magicians
* Grimnoir Chronicles - Larry Correia. Great concept, sort of an alt-history + xmen situation, although I didn't think the writing was great.
* The Lions of Al-Rassan - Guy Gavriel Kay
* The Winter King - Bernard Conwell. I enjoyed this way more than I expected, I tend to get bored with historical fiction. I'll probably check out other books by Cornwell
* Raven's Mark series - Ed Mcdonald. These were great, very reminiscent of Black Company. Colin Mace is probably my favorite narrator, he's really good
* Acts of Caine - Matthew Stover. I really enjoyed these. Very unique with great narration
* some of the Paladin Trilogy - Daniel M Ford. I wanted to like these as I love Michael Kramer, and this story has a classic feel to it. I lost interest during the second book.
* some of the King's Dark Tidings - around book 2 I decided I strongly disliked these
* some of the River of London series - I feel like I would like Urban fantasy, and enjoyed these for a while but lost interest
* some of the Dresden Files - Another urban fantasy attempt, also lost interest. Still suspect I should try other urban fantasy
* some of the Witcher series
* some of the Drenai series  
* Gentleman Bastards series
* Name of the Wind series
* Game of Thrones series

,audiobooks," Hi r/audiobooks!

The Children of Telm: The Complete Trilogy, my Epic Fantasy series (think The Lord of the Rings, etc.), is now on Audible, narrated by the amazing Simon Vance.

I've got some US and UK review copies available (via gifting). I have limited copies, so only apply if you love old-fashioned Epic Fantasy, and if you're willing to listen to the entire trilogy (a lot of the pay-off isn't until books 2 and 3).

Rules:

1. Comment on this post, letting me know if you want a US or UK copy.
2. Link your Audible review profile, or message it to me privately. (On desktop, click ""Listener Page"" and copy the link in the address bar. On mobile, find a book you recently reviewed, scroll to your review, and tap your name. This will bring you to your review profile. Copy this link. Alternatively, visit the desktop site on your mobile device and click ""Listener Page"" in the menu at the top. It should look something like: [https://www.audible.com/listener/ABCDEF12345](https://www.audible.com/listener/ABCDEF12345))
3. Also include your email address (I need this to gift the review copies). You can message this to me privately.
4. If you are selected, you are requested to rate the book on Audible and post a review when you're finished (on either the US or UK site). It doesn't have to be long or detailed. Just share your honest thoughts.

You can read more about the book and hear a sample here:

So I really enjoyed this series and was looking forward to the last book. It was everything I hoped for and continued the great world building and storytelling Scalzi has been doing through the series. 

At one point I realised there was only an hour or so left in the book and I thought “dang, there’s a lot of loops to close in an hour”. Then bang, quite literally, it ended. Cardenia dead, Nadashe’s coronation foiled, Marce can manipulate the Flow, everyone planning to go to End with no resolution to the “cant support everyone” arc, the Claremont family and Nafashe’s brother? It’s like John Scalzi just got bored of writing and hastily chucked an end together, or his printer was running out of ink, or... goddamit, I don’t know. 

I’m really bummed, I reckon there was another book’s worth of closure or at least a few hundred pages. I haven’t felt as unsatisfied with a story since reading Micro but that story’s issues were for a quite different reason (RIP Mr Crichton).

About the book:

Surrender, or face the consequences.

That’s the message that gets delivered to Meadowcity the day sixteen-year-old adventurer Sylvia Thorne comes home from her travels throughout the Four Cities. 

And the enemy won’t stop until he gets what he wants. Governor Sorin Greyling of Skycity has come a long way in the five years since he made a dark discovery about the Four Cities, and he’s willing to risk everything he values to bring his discovery to light.

Amidst a world of fantastical cities, dangerous creatures, and advanced technology that feels like magic, Sylvia must find a way to protect Meadowcity from Greyling, before the war reaches her home.  But when Sylvia gets in Sorin’s way, it could mean the end of Meadowcity.

The books are narrated by Philip Battley. They've been described as hilarious, whimsical, and somewhat dark. Because the novels do tend to get darker as the series progresses, these books are best suited for teens (13+) and adults.

If you enjoy Neil Gaiman, Douglas Adams, Lemony Snicket, or darker fables like A Monster Calls or The Book of Lost Things, then you might just like these.

US/UK codes are available, but I only have a limited number of each, so feel free to contact me if you’re interested.

 **The Sky Realms Online Books 1-3 Box Set is 30+ hours of epic LitRPG adventure set in a virtual world where anything can happen... maybe even death.** 

Hall had played the VRMMORPG, Sky Realms Online, since beta. During one gaming session, a freak accident traps Hall and other players in the game. They awaken to find out their bodies are comatose and they have been downloaded fully into the virtual world. Even worse, the rules have changed, they've been forced back to level 1, and permadeath might be possible.

Join Hall and his growing circle of friends and enemies, both Players and NPCs, as they discover that Sky Realms Online is not the same game they knew. New lands, new foes, and new mysteries.

**Grayhold (Book 1)**: Hall finds himself trapped in the game world, but not the game that he remembered. Things have changed. Hall gets his first quests, meets his first friends, and finds what could be his future home.

**Silverpeak (Book 2)**: Now the Lord of a ruined village, Hall takes his first steps toward turning Skara Brae into a real village. A journey to the city of Silver Peak Keep involves Hall and friends in a war between guilds.

**Axestorm (Book 3)**: Skara Brae is growing and it's time to take the next step. Hall and companions journey to the Dwarf fortress of Axestorm Hall in search of an airship. There they encounter more mysteries and another Player, Iron, who is working to conqueror the entire island of Huntley.  

**Grab this special edition box set today and dive headfirst into the action-packed world of Sky Realms Online.  It's a LitRPG saga perfect for fans of J.A.

In 2015, I was diagnosed with thyroid cancer and the same year I started my PhD program while still recovering from the illness. At the time, I was struggling with my health and other personal and professional setbacks. I was looking for books to cope with trauma, and while I found many motivational books, I did not find a practical, actionable handbook—so I wrote one. For years, I went back and forth on whether I should just keep it as my personal notes or publish it. Then in 2018, my cancer came back and I underwent treatment last year. While undergoing treatment a second time, I finally decided to update the book and get it ready for publication. I’m grateful that I am doing well health-wise now and also went on to complete my PhD.

The audiobook is one hour long. The techniques in this book are backed by research and have tremendously helped me. Although the book has a few instances from my life, the primary focus of the book is on coping and thriving after trauma.

,audiobooks,"Hi,

I'm looking for (audio) book suggestions, would be awesome if they were available on Audible.

About 2-3 years ago, I was heavily addicted to drugs, attempted to take my life countless times, had to spend a total of 4 weeks in the mental hospital, moved 8 times in a span of 3 years etc.

All of this left me in a very odd place in my life, where I feel like I'm constantly disturbed by my own thoughts and feel like I'm running from myself. I feel like things do have gotten a little better, but I'm still at this place, where I'm kind of fighting myself and the things that I do or think.

I think what would really help me, was some good audio books, that help guide my mind for the best me, that I really want to be. Since I can't really be bothered to work on myself using ""regular"" methods, like breathing exercises, meditation, therapy or whatsoever, having a fairly busy life and low energy, motivation and bad life circumstances, I was wondering if there's a book that might give me a little push and take my mind off some of the negative stuff or convert it into positive.

What I ideally look for, is something  that has a little bit of dreamy/fantasy element to it, but that would also keep me grounded and focused in the real world, since I do work as a software developer.

It would also be awesome, if it was an inspiring story and something that possibly educates me a little on life matters, and that helps progress in this fast-paced ""modern world"" that we live in.

,audiobooks,"I've recently published the Aesop Player (for Android). It's completely free, and ad-free. (I derive no revenue from it.) I created it for a relative who wanted to listen to books, but couldn't use the usual smart phone touchscreen (even with the usual accessibility interfaces) and couldn't manage changing CDs or juggling a large device.

For example, one of the UI actions for starting/stopping the book is flipping the whole phone or tablet face down to stop, and back up to continue. Book titles are displayed in a giant font, and announced audibly. It can be configured to be very ""fumble-proof"" so users who have problems managing objects won't accidentally get themselves into an unusable state. Both volume and speed can be set without having to look at the screen.

It's a book player, focused on books, not a music player that happens to play books.  It will back up a selectable amount and reread a bit after stopping to get back into the context. Books are seen as a single entity; it takes care of issues such as chapters being in separate files. (Even a book of books such as War and Peace.) There are a number of other features that allow you to adapt it to a range of usage styles.

It's designed to be able to work with remote access software so it is possible to add or remove books and configure it remotely.  The documentation includes instructions for installing books from Librivox and similar sites, and also how to install library books from various sources that allow that if you have a library account. It tracks book position, and remembers if the book has been played to the end so it's not necessary to guess about that.

Even if you aren't interested for yourself, you may have a friend or relative that can't easily use audio books with conventional players. This may work for them.

It&amp;#39;s completely free, and ad-free. (I derive no revenue from it.) I created it for a relative who wanted to listen to books, but couldn&amp;#39;t use the usual smart phone touchscreen (even with the usual accessibility interfaces) and couldn&amp;#39;t manage changing CDs or juggling a large device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, one of the UI actions for starting/stopping the book is flipping the whole phone or tablet face down to stop, and back up to continue. Book titles are displayed in a giant font, and announced audibly. It can be configured to be very &amp;quot;fumble-proof&amp;quot; so users who have problems managing objects won&amp;#39;t accidentally get themselves into an unusable state. Both volume and speed can be set without having to look at the screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a book player, focused on books, not a music player that happens to play books.  It will back up a selectable amount and reread a bit after stopping to get back into the context. Books are seen as a single entity; it takes care of issues such as chapters being in separate files. (Even a book of books such as War and Peace.) There are a number of other features that allow you to adapt it to a range of usage styles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s designed to be able to work with remote access software so it is possible to add or remove books and configure it remotely.  The documentation includes instructions for installing books from Librivox and similar sites, and also how to install library books from various sources that allow that if you have a library account. It tracks book position, and remembers if the book has been played to the end so it&amp;#39;s not necessary to guess about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you aren&amp;#39;t interested for yourself, you may have a friend or relative that can&amp;#39;t easily use audio books with conventional players. This may work for them.&lt;/p&gt;

Keeping track of sources is the main reason I started this thing, because after a while, it becomes hard to remember where I got a particular book, especially since I'm a member of several different libraries, plus Audible.

The link will give you a read-only version, but you can save it to your own Airtable account and make any changes you wish.  You'll need to make an account if you don't have one.

,audiobooks,"As a book addict who used to HATE reading more than anything but just like a 4 years old who had to eat his veggies to grow bigger and stronger, it took me time to get used to liking reading and making it a daily habit I was pondering an idea:

What do I need now or could’ve needed to get me to like reading and/or absorbing the necessary knowledge efficiently and fast?

I narrowed down the possible ideas into creating a youtube channel, and “yeah here we go, just another youtube channel” was the first thing that popped into my mind.

I’m aware there are be a lot of channels doing the exact same thing which is the reason I’m writing this.

And because quality content, true value, and a unique proposition are the most important aspects, there was no better idea than asking the audience themselves.

So if you could just brainstorm random ideas you wish could be present now but aren’t, things existing channels are doing that need improvement, things that already exist but there should be more off, etc.

For example one of the first things that came into my mind is that most people I’ve seen present amazing information, but since books, knowledge and information are considered “serious matters”, they take it very seriously as well.

So if there’s room for adding some more light, different video formatting, maybe some memes every now and then (all in context of course) – it could add an additional dosage of entertainment that isn’t too present in most books.

The answers to this post will probably be the main factor of determining whether I go on with this or not because if I’m not going to bring value or differentiate myself then there’s no need to make “just another channel”

,audiobooks,"Hello everyone. I am the author of Dark &amp; Day.

Thank you all so much for the enthusiasm and support for the Dark &amp; Day series so far! Audible just released Dark &amp; Day 3: The Angels' Masquerade and I have US and UK codes to share.

**How to get codes:** As you know, Audible has limited codes dramatically from the past, and since this is the third book in the series you'd really want to know what happened before this. Here's the deal, if you buy Dark &amp; Day 1 and message me a link to your review, I'll send you codes for BOTH Dark &amp; Day 2: The Withering Mark and Dark &amp; Day 3: The Angels' Masquerade. I'll also put you at the front of the line for codes for Dark &amp; Day 4: The Impossible Quest, which is published and the narrator is working on it now! I'm currently starting to write Dark &amp; Day 5: The Fragile Tower.

In honor of my first book going live on Audible, I’ve decided to repay some of the kindness I’ve received from many of the fine folk in this sub over the years in the form of US and UK promo codes! *Slab Steele and the Venusian Exchange* is the first installment in the Worlds of Craterball series. The second installment, *Slab Steele and the Outer Rim Job*, will hopefully be out by the end of the year, with an audiobook to follow shortly.

*Slab Steele was once the hottest craterback prospect coming out of Texas Space University, but a series of self-engineered screw ups have left him without the hope of joining the greatest craterback to ever play the game, Mirt “The Whip” Ballfeather, in the Craterball Hall of Fame.*  

*Once reduced to playing backup for the worst team in the league, the Venus Flytrap, Slab has finally got his life back on track. Slab Steele - through no significant achievement of his own - is on the verge of winning the Crater Bowl. On the eve of the biggest match of his life, the deciding Match Seven of the Solar Craterball Finals, Slab Steele is knocked out and taken captive by two die-hard fans of the rival team. There’s only one problem: Slab isn’t even the starter.* 

*Suddenly, Slab Steele is thrust into an adventure that forces him to confront a ghost from his past, meet a hero from his present, and ultimately come to terms with a future unlike any he has ever known, all while trying to make it to Venus in time for the Crater Bowl.*  

Check it out and listen to a flaring sample here, bruh: [https://bit.ly/SlabSteeleAudiobook](https://bit.ly/SlabSteeleAudiobook)

If you’re still with me, I bet you’re asking yourself, “How the flare do I get one those soldamn codes, Ron?!” Well, here’s how it works, bruh. Keep in mind these codes are limited and are intended to generate flaring reviews, okay?

1. You post which kind of code you would like, US or UK. To prove that you have a genuine interest in listening, please include your favorite pun or one liner. **Ron like pun. Pun is life.** You can also send me a private message if you’re scared of the whole putting-yourself-out-there-with-a-bad-joke thing. 
2. Feel free to PM me your listener profile page to show how wicked awesome you are at writing reviews, bruh. Completely subjective and meaningless bonus points will be awarded if you do. And I’ll probably put you down on the list for sequel codes.
3. Listen to the flaring thing! If you have any thoughts at the end, feel free to share them in the form of a review. Reviews are not required, but they are the mayonnaise and mustard on the turkey sandwich of literary success. Help me double meat my flaring sandwich, bruh.

Joyce, Effie and BB are cowgirl goddesses on Mount Olympus who lament  what they see down on earth.  It’s a cowboy’s world. Cocky steer-ropers have stolen the spotlight for long enough. The goddesses decide to use  their considerable supernatural powers to give rise to a Cowgirl Revolution. When they discover Cassidy Clark, a talented, charismatic loner from Okotoks, Alberta, they know they have found the barrel racer poised to lead their cause. The three goddesses appear to her one day,  offering her all the gifts she will need to earn her first buckle at the  Canadian Finals Rodeo championship. We follow Cassidy atop her trusty mare, Starbright, as she rises to the top of the circuit, throwing back shots of Jack Daniels and two-stepping along the way. Cassidy wrestles with her new-found fame, and just how far she will push herself and Starbright in pursuit of their dream.

It's a beautiful story, deeply rooted in the Canadian Rodeo scene, with a magical, fantastical twist.

Full disclosure: I'm one of the producers of the show at the CBC. It's free to listen, and family-friendly.

,audiobooks,"Hello, good people!

Let me apologize in advance if this is the sort of post you get all the time; I did quite a bit of research by myself, discussed it over at r/Fantasy, and in a recent discussion, I was advised to come and ask you here! I also read the FAQ, but didn't find my answers, so here I am. I want to know what the users can tell me of their apps from experience, 'cause I find you can never tell if the service is going to be as advertized in big bold letters, can you?

So here goes the thing: I currently have Downpour, but am not really satisfied with it: it was supposed to be possible to borrow books DRM-free and return them after a period of time, which I found cool. However, none of the books on my list are available to borrow! (Arrrrrr, frustration!) Add to that the fact that some books cost more that your monthly credit, and you'll understand my lack of satisfaction. I'm keeping it at the moment because it seems to be one of the few apps that have the series I'm currently on, in unabridged version. 

BUT, I mean to switch as soon as I'm through with it, and that's where you come in, if you would be so kind!

Here are my criterias:

\- Has to be available off-line

\- Not too expensive, as I use audiobook format to get through my physical books faster. I don't really want to buy every book twice! It can absolutely be DRM-free!

\- I don't live in the US, and we don't have a system of public libraries with Overdrive for example, so that doesn't work

\- Aaaaaand, I refuse to give my money to Amazon, so that rules Audible out.

,audiobooks,"&amp;#x200B;

I’m looking for help finding a new portable audio player/unit to purchase for my **Audiobooks** and **Lecture Series**.

I would love the input from people who are more seasoned with DAP units than I am.

&amp;#x200B;

# Things to know:

* I’m on a Mac
* It must have a bookmarking function OR, at the very least, a ‘resume’ function
* I need to be able to expand the memory to 2TB
* Bluetooth is a necessity
* Touchscreen is a necessity
* Physical Size of the unit must be manageable. **I** currently **have a HIDIZS AP80** . **It’s** awesome but it’s too small for me to work the progress slider when I return to an audiobook or lecture. It lacks an intuitive resume or pause option so I have to manually move the slider to where I last ended and the screen is **simply** **too** **small** for me to manage this without great difficulty.
* File Types - I really need it to be able to recognize MP3, WAV, FLAC, APE, WMA, MP4, and if possible, m4b
* Spotify Integration would be great. I have never used a portable unit with this capability but I've been reading about it and would be interested in a unit that can do this.
* Price Range - I’d like to stay **under $200**

&amp;#x200B;

# My concerns:

* Playlists - how easy or difficult it is to create a Playlist, as well as how many playlists the unit allows
* How many songs/files the unit can hold 
* WiFi - I would like it to have WiFi
* FM Radio - I would like it to have an FM radio
* Battery Life - I’d like it to last all day, if possible.
* Video - it would be great if it played video but it’s not necessary.  I have iPods. I want to get away from Apple and Cell Phone type devices.  Podcasts - it would be great to be able to play Podcasts easily with the unit
* UI - it would be nice to find a unit with a really smooth, fast, and intuitive UI.Support - Again, it would be great if the company selling/making the unit has a strong customer support presence, but if there are active user forums out there for the unit I’d be A-OK with using that in place of customer support (so long as the discussions are healthy and up to date).

&amp;#x200B;

I’m currently entertaining the possibility of the **Sony NW-A45/B Walkman** with Hi-Res Audio. And the **FiiO M6 Hi Res Lossless** but I’d really like to hear from more seasoned DAP owners what your preferences might be and what you consider the Pro’s and Con’s of your suggested units.

I could give a list of the books I&amp;#39;ve read/audiobooks I&amp;#39;ve listened to if you guys think it&amp;#39;d help.&lt;/p&gt;

During quarantine, I thought I would learn how to develop apps. So I went ahead and built one that would fulfill my needs of allowing chapter selection within OverDrive mp3s. Of course, it works like a conventional audiobook player app too, where it will load non-OverDrive books.

Anyways, I'd like to keep developing it and to add features in the future such as:

\-Bookmarks

\-Syncing book location/bookmark data with the cloud

\-Storing and being able to play your books from the cloud (kinda like Plex)

\-Ebook support

\-Goodreads support to allowing rating a book within the app

&amp;#x200B;

I'd love anyone's feedback too!

,audiobooks," As a part of Audible’s big summer sale (7.95/mo for the first four months), consider picking up my audiobook Death by Polka:

&gt;Who killed Polish Lou, the famous Prince of Polka Music? His daughter, musicologist Lottie Kachowski, comes home to the polka heartland of Johnstown, Pennsylvania, to find the answer. Lottie has an unbeatable talent for using music to solve crimes, and she does just that on the trail of her father's killer. At the same time, she fights to keep from getting dragged back into the polka scene she left behind long ago, though her father's will name her his successor as head of his polka empire. Lottie puts everything on the line, even as the killer puts her in his sights, and she won't give up. Because when you've got polka in your blood, you just know the bad guy's going to face the music.

Best of all, it’s narrated by the amazing Carol Herman, a longtime TV and movie actress with an incredible gift for fun and mystery.

,audiobooks,"The extremely talented Mark Boyett has narrated almost all my audiobooks, and he really knocked it out of the park with Mech Wars.

It's a series about a private military company that finds itself stranded in another galaxy, surrounded by hostile alien forces.

Best of all, I've realized that I still have a limited number of download codes to give out for the entire series.

I'm sure you know how this goes!

1 [Check out the series page](https://www.audible.com/series/Mech-Wars-Audiobooks/B074KPTTNF) and see if it piques your interest

2 Comment below and **tell me if you need a code for US or UK**

Do that, and I'll message out codes until they run out.

(Audible doesn't offer codes outside of US and UK sadly.)

Note - so that I stay in compliance with Audible's Conditions of Use: the idea with these codes is that you'll leave a review after listening. I'm the author of this series, and your review goes a long way.

Thank you for your support. :)

**UPDATE:** I'm out of US codes but working on trying to get some new ones. If you're in the US and interested in the series, you can still comment to reserve one of the new codes - provided I'm able to get them. If you're in the UK: I still have plenty of codes for you, so comment away!

6 hours 39 minutes in length and narrated by Kae Marie Denino, who was a joy to work with.

Join a teen’s struggle with secret powers in a demonic dystopia.
Aubrey never realized there was a better life beyond being the rebel leader’s disappointing teenage daughter. But when she’s abducted by the government and taught the truth at one of their official academies, she feels torn between two worlds. Wielding a power she didn’t know she had and forced to open a portal to a dark dimension, she must choose who to save — her new friends or her family.
Can Aubrey master her power in time to prevent the world’s utter annihilation?

,audiobooks,"""Seeker of The Silver Wolf"" is a Fantasy novel I am in the midst of writing - and recording!

Description: The story follows Shayna, a young member of the Seekers Sanctuary where those people with the ability to read into the memories and experiences of others - a talent called reaching -  live. The story takes place in the not so wide world of Fahrul, a city encased in constant roiling sandstorms, governed by the overbearing High Council. But is there more to the city? What lies beyond the sands? What role does the council truly play, and why is Shayna struggling to return from a recent reaching?

I am releasing the story chapter by chapter every Sunday at 3:00am for all of you early risers (or **late** sleepers). Be sure to join in on the story and listen as it unfolds in your ears!

Chapter 4 releases tomorrow morning.

The best part? It is completely free to listen! My audiobook is available on my blog, Spotify, Apple Podcasts, and a general RSS feed for those that do not use either service.

,audiobooks,"So I've used Voice on Android for years, but recently I decided to switch to iPhone since SE was getting great reviews and my computer and tablet are Apple as well. I saw the stickied post about the answers most people give, but it's a bit lacking since there's no pros and cons or anything, and I'm a blank slate on iOS, because the file architecture is different, right down to the fact I can't even use an SD card which is where my audiobooks went on the old phone. 

So I listen to a lot of audiobooks, but I don't think I'm needing anything too crazy, Voice was a free app, and it played all but one or two of the books I threw at it, with VLC handling the strays. I'm fine with kicking a few bucks at an app, especially a quality one, but I don't want to buy three different apps before finding one I like.

Wish list

* Can use multiple file types, mp3, m4a, CUE, and folders for audiobooks that are multiple files

* Ability to rename once they're in the app would be great

* Up to 2.5x speed

* Remember playback of multiple books at the same time

* Must be able to put audiobooks on the phone storage instead of streaming them, (they won't give me the wifi password at work which is where I do almost all my listening)

* I really like knowing either A the percentage of the way I am through the book, or B both current place and total length. I was really irritated when Voice stopped showing my current location and only showed how much was left.

Bounty: A Dark Romance

She thought she could get the best of me. She got my belt, instead.

After I went undercover to take down a mob boss and ended up betrayed, framed, and on the run, Harper Rollins tried to bring me in. But instead of collecting a bounty, she earned herself a hard spanking and then an even rougher lesson that left her cute bottom sore in a very different way.

She's not one to give up without a fight, but that's fine by me. It just means I'll have plenty more chances to welt her beautiful backside and then make her scream her surrender into the sheets.

You may have seen some of my work posted here before under a different account, specifically the M/M Romance Series **Love in Three Lakes**. With the entire series behind me now and a new book releasing this week (look out for codes for that one on Saturday morning) I'm going to be promoting my entire catalog weekly on Freebie Friday.

Here are the rules for getting a code:

DM me for your codes. You're welcome to post below but the fastest way to reach me will be through a direct message.

Let me know which books you're interested in a code for. If I listed it then I had codes when I made this post.

I have codes for both the US [https://audible.com/acx-promo](https://audible.com/acx-promo) and the UK [https://audible.co.uk/acx-promo](https://audible.co.uk/acx-promo) Audible storefront so please specify your region with your request.

I do, of course, have a limited number of codes and when they're out they're out.

If you receive a code I ask only that you leave an honest rating on Audible for each code you receive once you've finished, hopefully with a write-up.

This is basically an open-source alternative for proprietary solutions like Amazon's Whispersync. The code is available on github: [https://github.com/r4victor/syncabook](https://github.com/r4victor/syncabook).

Anyone can create such an ebook and then listen to it using any reader that supports EPUB3 with Media Overlays. I use [Readium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/readium/fepbnnnkkadjhjahcafoaglimekefifl) and [Menestrello](https://www.readbeyond.it/menestrello/). Unfortunately, the former is going to be deprecated and the latter is inactive for quite a while. Please tell me if you know of other readers that support this feature.

I've developed it primarily to produce read-along ebooks for LibriVox recordings. Here is a repository containing those that have already been synchronized: [https://github.com/r4victor/synclibrivox](https://github.com/r4victor/synclibrivox).

Do that, and I'll message out codes until they run out.

(Audible doesn't offer codes outside of US and UK sadly.)

Note - so that I stay in compliance with Audible's Conditions of Use:  the idea with these codes is that you'll leave a review after listening. I'm the author of this series, and your review goes a long way.

Thank you for your support. :)

**UPDATE:** I'm out of US codes but working on trying to get some new ones. If you're in the US and interested in the series, you can still comment  to reserve one of the new codes - provided I'm able to get them. If you're in the UK: I still have plenty of codes for you, so comment away!

,audiobooks,"Hey everyone.
I’m not looking to bring toxicity into your community rather I’m trying to understand different points of views. Right off the bat I want to say, I’m not a fan of audiobooks due to a key observation I’ve made over the years:

Audiobooks reward completion over understanding. 

Too many times have I seen people pick up audiobooks and say they put them on 1.5x or even 2x speed just to:
A. Get through the book quickly
B. Meet their goal of one book a week
C. Claim some form of understanding

I find it mind boggling. Taking in a book, for me at least, is a commitment. It’s an activity for which I have to set aside a large interval of time to focus solely on reading. I find that audiobooks like music open the door to multitasking and at the end of the day, they simply become background noise. It’s like trying to focus on each little detail of the bass, drums, guitar, and vocals while doing a hand stand. Has it come to the point were people really can’t sit down and devote their attention to a single task? Audiobooks seem like a hassle in terms of letting me go back to check if I truly understood something so in the end they seem conducive to a single listen just for people to tick that checkbox and move on.

However, I know I can’t use my observations as a generalization. I’m not an auditive person, visual more than anything, so it might further prove how disconnected I am. So for that reason, I signed up for a free trial on audible, and I wanted to ask which recommendations you guys could give me for my first audiobook.

What value do you guys find in audiobooks? How do you listen to them? Has it dramatically changed your way of taking in information? How about the understanding vs. completion problem I mentioned? Is that part of my argument valid?

The audio only is of course easier and quicker to dl and takes up less storage but in some cases the visual component is useful in enhancing understanding if you are able to watch as well as listen.

Their current deal is a free 14 day trial (one month with the promo code FREEMO then either monthly ($19.99 A month or quarterly $30 a quarter.) obviously the quarterly option is much better value.

This allows unlimited listening to their 100s of lecture series.

*Bash Trawler* wants to find an easy summer job so he can get back to partying with his friends. When he discovers an advertisement in the local paper for night watch at a nearby funeral home he jumps at the chance to make quick money. But staying up all night watching corpses for an eccentric war vet turns into something out of his worst nightmares.  


*Casey McClair* wants to make the tennis team. Popularity has never come easily to her and she’s willing to practice into the late evening and follow all the rules of the game if it means she’ll finally find acceptance. But when she's kidnapped, she'll have to fight to survive a harrowing ordeal with a cold and calculated serial killer.  


*Serial Killer X* knows about pain. He's been through the worst of what humans do to each other. The thrill is in the fight and he'll make sure his victims know it.

,audiobooks,"I was in a bit of a hurry yesterday to get an audiobook to listen to so I downloaded the iPhone audible app and signed up for a membership without thinking much of it. The payment went through the Apple Store with my Apple ID, which was $24.99 +taxes (Canadian). That was more than I remembered it being a few years ago so I checked audible's website and they show the monthly price to be $14.99 +taxes.

I'm struggling to understand why there would be such a difference in price depending on how you sign up. The $24.99/month only gets you 1 credit a month, and the app doesn't let you make cash purchases for any additional audiobooks, instead you have to buy another credit for $24.99.

*The Wrath of Lords*

 **When heroes fail, send a monster.**  


When a dispute with a band of bloodthirsty mercenaries turns deadly, the townspeople want Warden Esben Berengar held accountable. The local lord offers to overlook Berengar's crimes in exchange for help finding his niece, abducted by a monster.  


But nothing's ever that easy, and Berengar soon finds himself cursed by a witch. He has three days to lift the curse and face the monsters--human and otherwise--that stand in his way to save the girl.  


Berengar's no hero, but he'll have to do. Darker times are coming, and the land of Fál needs a warden more than ever.  


Step into a dangerous new world of fantasy and magic, where the greatest monsters are the ones that lurk inside us. 

&amp;#x200B;

*The Blood of Kings*

Being a warden is tough work at the best of times. Keeping the tenuous peace between the five kingdoms of Fál is a difficult business, especially in a land of monsters and magic.  


Esben Berengar, the realm’s most feared warden, relies on his wits and his axe to deal with unscrupulous rulers, bloodthirsty outlaws, and the occasional witch.  


When the king of Munster is murdered, Berengar is called upon to investigate. Many had cause to want the king dead, and treachery lurks behind every corner.  


As tensions between humans and all others threaten to boil over, the warden finds himself reluctantly partnered with Morwen, Munster’s court magician, to solve the murder before the killer strikes at the royal family again. 

&amp;#x200B;

*The City of Thieves*

The hunt for a mysterious enemy leads Berengar to Dún Aulin, where an old friend’s request thrusts him headfirst into danger. It’s up to Berengar to prevent the sword used by the Lord of Shadows in his conquest of Fál from falling into the wrong hands.

To do that, he’ll have to survive vengeful goblins, bloodthirsty monster hunters, Leinster’s powerful Thieves Guild, and worse.

,audiobooks,"Greetings friends. [Giving away 100 audiobooks over the next 30 days.](https://kingsumo.com/g/rk6rvk/100-audiobooks-by-lancelot-schaubert) — I am the author and Theo narrated. 

100 copies of three stories. Quick summary of each:

# [**WILDERNESS (thriller / crime / mystery):**](https://kingsumo.com/g/rk6rvk/100-audiobooks-by-lancelot-schaubert)

When a seventeen-year-old track star turns up mangled and dead on the switchback road by the Crescent Hotel, his poker crew grows suspicious of one another. Ebur, a retired cowboy, finds himself in the middle of a once-trustworthy group who all knew and loved Brady.

Or did they?

And can he trust them if they think he killed the boy?

Covering the broad swatch of lifestyles and struggles in off-peak Eureka Springs, Wilderness asks hard questions about retired men and those who try to tame them.

# [**WOMBROVERS** (fantasy / sci-fi)](https://kingsumo.com/g/rk6rvk/100-audiobooks-by-lancelot-schaubert)

At ten feet, four inches tall, Gowanus was the runt of the litter. Working the mines of No’ad took strength and height, unless you had the smarts to be able to help the dwarves invent and build new mining tools. He didn’t have smarts and didn’t have height, and yet his curiosity got the better of him: where had Sakima gone?

In an attempt to find the rogue giant Sakima, Gowanus learns the secret to how the giants have spread so far, so fast and comes face-to-face with the worst betrayal of giant-kind.

# [**CARRY CANNONS BY OUR SIDE** (pirate fantasy)](https://kingsumo.com/g/rk6rvk/100-audiobooks-by-lancelot-schaubert)

A young pirate-in-training shadows his dad as his father chases down the man who stole his cargo. Confronted with cannons, the young pirate fears their tiny fifteen-man crew will die quickly, but his father shows him a magic more powerful than all the cannon fire in the world. The only problem? It's not iron and cotton the other pirate stole.

It's precious human life.

I like strong female characters that are not defined by a man, nerdy male characters that are oblivious to love, children who have adult personalities but still don&amp;#39;t have those urges because they are too young, and non-human characters that just ignore that aspect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I prefer Sci-Fi and Fantasy, but dislike depressing settings like dystopias/ post apocalyptic. I like humor but not when it becomes the utter nonsense satire of Douglas Adams, Terry Pratchett, or Christopher Moore.

,audiobooks,"I’m proud to be the narrator of Infinitum One: Origin, a fun new take on the superhero genre. 

Publisher’s Description: 

Not all heroes are heroes because they want to be...sometimes, they’re heroes because they’re chosen to be.

——

Ed Helquist never asked for superhuman strength, or extraordinary speed, or the voice in his blood that tells him when and where trouble will occur; those things just arose in him one day, calling him into danger and forcing him to help people without knowing why. His best friend Casey has a ridiculous theory: somehow Ed is becoming a superhero, an idea that Ed just can’t allow himself to believe. When Lane Daniels appears and reminds Ed of an extraordinary incident from their childhood that supports the possibility, Ed has no choice but to allow that his powers have been with him for longer than he’s realized - and now, they seem to be evolving. His simple life is becoming more and more complicated every minute, and a mysterious woman who keeps showing up to cause trouble may hold the answers to everything...if only she she’d stop trying to kill him long enough for him to ask.
